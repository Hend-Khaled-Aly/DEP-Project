Overview
We need a simple yet efficient Web App for a small taxi business, allowing passengers to book trips online seamlessly. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for customers to enter trip details, calculate fares, make payments, and enable admins to manage bookings efficiently.



Core Features & Functionality

1. Customer Booking Form  
Customers should be able to enter the following details:  
- Customer Name  
- Customer mobile number
- Pick-up Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Drop-off Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Number of Passengers
- Add Stop/Multiple Destinations Option (if required)  
- Date & Time Selection:
  - Book Now (immediate trip request)  
  - Schedule for Later (calendar-based date & time selection)  

2. Fare Calculation & Payment Processing  
- The system will calculate the trip fare based on a formula that we will provide later.  
- Customers proceed with payment, which will be held in escrow (or any better alternative recommended by the developer).  

3. Booking Approval Process (Admin Panel)  
- Admin receives a notification for each booking request.  
- Admin can Accept or Reject the booking.  
- If Rejected: Payment is automatically refunded, and the customer is notified with the reason (e.g., ""No driver available"").  
- If Accepted:  
  - Admin is prompted to assign the ride to a driver from a predefined driver list.  
  - Customer receives booking confirmation text with driver details  

4. Ride Completion & Cancellation Handling
- Once a ride is accepted, admin is prompted with:  
  - End Ride (indicating the trip was successfully completed).  
  - Ride Cancelled (if a cancellation occurs).  
- If the ride is cancelled after being accepted, the payment is refunded back to the customer automatically.  

5. Driver Management (Admin Panel)  
- Ability to maintain a list of drivers in the system.  
- Assign drivers to accepted rides.  
- Show assigned driver details to customers upon booking confirmation.  



Technical Considerations
- Google Maps API for location inputs and fare estimation.  
- Escrow-based payment solution (or developer‚Äôs recommendation for an alternative secure transaction system).  
- Admin Panel for managing bookings and drivers.  
- Responsive UI (desktop & mobile-friendly). We can provide this if needed.
- Scalability for future mobile app development (Android & iOS).  

We look forward to a long-term collaboration for future improvements and eventually mobile app development.  Looking forward to working with the right developer to help grow our small passenger transport business! üôè",$50.00,,"['$50.00', '']",Expert,"['Web Application', 'C#', 'JavaScript', 'PHP', 'Python', 'Square', 'Web Development', 'Haskell', 'Java', 'Payment Gateway Integration']",5 to 10,2.0,0.0,0.0,$1.4K,,,43.0,19.0,,

They will share the same database.

I want to create a website and mobile app which will teach people the Qaidah (A book which teaches them the basics of learning Arabic and the Quran).

I want this website/app to have recording and listening capabilities.

Here is how it works...

The user registers an account and is then presented with words and lessons.

He will be able to make a recording of his pronunciation for each word. That whole lesson will be saved and sent to me for correction. I will then be able to record my response in one file and send it back to him.

The user would record the words for every lesson, and the website would keep a record of their recordings, until I can come and check their recordings and then provide them some feedback (by audio file also).

This would be a membership site where I would need to charge people for my time for listening and correcting them. 

It would need a membership script where people can register an account and log in and continue their lessons.

Their own account will contain their own recordings and my responses.

The account area will display lessons in order, and they can progress from one lesson to the  
next.

I may even employ teachers who can listen to the recordings, and so the website/app has to have the ability to accommodate this.

There has to be a good way for them to record one word at a time, next to each of the words that I give them. So the layout has to be good.

Then the site should allow me to create responses next to that word too, both text and audio.

The layout of each lesson should be nice to look at.

Only when I click a button can they move on to the next lesson.

To avoid clogging the database with thousands of recordings, they should all be purged 10 days  
after they have been first listened to.

The same functionality that is on the website (for the user), it should also be on the mobile app.

My full requirements are written on Trello.

You can see it here: https://trello.com/b/cw5IFlI7/quran-pilot

Just read each card one at a time, in order.

Let me know how much it would cost me and how long it would take, if you are able to do it.

The widget should closely resemble Duolingo's streak widget in functionality and design.

Key Requirements:

1. Integration with Flutter:

The project is part of a Flutter application.

The background for the home screen widget will be determined in the Flutter code.

Relevant variables (e.g., whether the user has completed their daily lesson) will be supplied, but the backgrounds will not be fetched from the backend.



2. Widget Design & Components:

The widget should include:

A widget background (stored on the frontend).

A streak icon.

Streak text displaying the number of consecutive days (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).


I will provide all widget backgrounds, as well as an example image to illustrate the desired design, including the exact positioning of the streak text, streak icons, and other elements.



3. Dynamic Backgrounds and Icons:

Backgrounds: There will be multiple options for widget backgrounds:

If the user has not completed their daily lesson, the widget should randomly select from five options designated for this state. (I have attached example layouts)

If the user has completed their daily lesson, the widget should randomly select from five different options.


Streak Icon: The streak icon should dynamically change based on whether the user has completed their daily lesson.



4. Conditional Updates:

The streak text color (e.g., 1, 2, 3) should be gray if the user has not completed their daily lesson.

Both the streak icon and the widget background should reflect the completion status of the daily lesson.



5. Live Updates:

The widget must support real-time updates to ensure it reflects changes immediately after a user completes a lesson.

This could involve implementing a listener or similar mechanism to synchronize the widget state dynamically.



6. Confidentiality:

As part of this project, you will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property.




If you are interested and meet these requirements, please reach out. I will provide the necessary resources, including widget backgrounds, example images, and backend variables for the project.



Requirements:  
- Fetch streak and lesson completion status dynamically from the backend whenever the homescreen is opened or updated.  
- The widget should work seamlessly for both iOS and Android platforms.  
- Use any Flutter package necessary to implement the functionality efficiently.  
- Fix Directory Issues: Resolve missing or broken folders in my Android and iOS directories to ensure compatibility with the existing project.  
- Platform Detection: Ensure the app can dynamically detect whether the user is on iOS or Android and use the appropriate native implementation.
Make any necessary changes on the Flutter side to guarantee compatibility and proper integration with platform-specific features.
- Code Responsibility: You will be responsible for making the necessary changes to the Flutter codebase to ensure seamless functionality of the widget.

Deliverables:  
1. Fully functional widget code for both iOS and Android platforms.  
2. Ensure dynamic fetching and updates of streak and lesson completion data.  
3. Fix any issues with my current Android and iOS project directories.  
4. Provide all source code files and ensure compatibility with my existing project.
5. Make the n

Additional Requirements:  
- NDA: You must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before starting the project.  
- Code Ownership: Upon completion and payment, the code will become my property, and you must destroy any copies.  
- Fixed Price: Provide a fixed price for the project.  
- Confidentiality: You are not allowed to share the code or any details of this project with others.  

Preferences:  
- Experience with creating homescreen widgets for Flutter.  
- Strong debugging skills to resolve directory and compatibility issues.  

If you are interested, please share:  
1. Examples of similar work you have done in Flutter.  
2. Your fixed price quote for the project.

Technical Requirements:
Flutter for cross-platform development (iOS and Android)
Backend integration using Firebase (Cloud Storage, Hosting, Cloud Messaging, Analytics)
Experience integrating Apple StoreKit and Google Play Billing Library for IAP
Version control via Git (GitHub preferred)
Experience setting up CI/CD (Codemagic or Bitrise) is a bonus
Familiarity with JSON data handling and optimized media assets (JPEG, MP3/AAC audio)
Ideal Candidate Should Have:

What We Will Provide:
Complete UI/UX designs in Figma (collaboration with a UX/UI designer)
High-quality, professionally illustrated JPEG images for each book
Professionally recorded audio narration and subtitles
Clear project documentation and prompt communication throughout the project
Budget and Timeline:
Please propose your fixed-price offer based on the described scope.
Estimated timeline: approximately 6‚Äì8 weeks (negotiable based on your input).

Our mobile application (available on both iOS and Android) is experiencing intermittent crashes when users attempt to upload media files larger than 10MB. The crash occurs specifically during the compression process before upload begins. Our analytics show this affects approximately 8% of our user base, primarily on devices running iOS 16+ and Android 11+.
The issue appears to be related to memory management during the compression algorithm execution. The app successfully handles smaller files but fails to properly allocate resources for larger media. Debug logs show ""OutOfMemoryError"" exceptions on Android and ""Memory Warning"" followed by termination on iOS.

Requirements:

Strong experience with both iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) development
Expertise in media handling, compression algorithms, and memory optimization
Familiarity with troubleshooting crash reports and performance issues
Ability to quickly navigate unfamiliar codebases
Experience implementing cross-platform solutions

    Performance Optimization ‚Äì Any inefficiencies that could slow things down?
    Error Handling & Stability ‚Äì Any weak points that might cause crashes or bad user experiences?
    Scalability & Maintainability ‚Äì Would this codebase be easy to expand and maintain long-term?

I don‚Äôt need vague feedback‚ÄîI need specific recommendations. If something can be done in a better way, tell me how. If there are anti-patterns, unnecessary complexity, or missing optimizations, call them out.
Who I‚Äôm Looking For:

    Strong Kotlin & Android experience (Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Coroutines, etc.)

Hello,
We have developed a Quiz Elite-like Q&A application that helps students practice and learn by answering subject-related questions. Users can create rooms, compete with each other, and collaborate.

However, due to an unfortunate accident involving our previous developer, the project was left incomplete. We are now looking for a talented developer to finish the remaining features.

Pending Features:
‚úÖ Single-Player Mode: A system that allows users to play individually.
‚úÖ Live Chat System:

Students should be able to join admin-created rooms and chat live.
The admin panel should allow unlimited room creation, with the ability to open and close rooms at specific times.
Moderation Controls:
Admin should be able to ban disruptive users and assign moderators.
Users should have the ability to block, report, or mute messages from inappropriate or disruptive individuals.
üí° Alternative Solution: The chat system does not necessarily have to be integrated within the app. We have our own server, so we can redirect users to a web-based chat system. A subdomain-based separate system is also an option. I trust your professional approach‚Äîmy priority is a reliable, fast, and seamless solution.

Our workers use a custom-built app to log their timesheets daily, and these records form the basis for payroll processing and client invoicing. However, our current system is inefficient because the backend database is on a separate platform from Google Sheets. As a result, our bookkeeper must manually copy and paste data between systems, slowing down operations.

Our goal is to integrate Google Sheets as the backend database to automate processes, streamline payroll, and eventually integrate AI-driven features for further efficiency.

Project Overview

We need an experienced developer to update our existing app while keeping the current functionality intact. The focus is on integrating Google Sheets as the backend database. We want to ensure that:

All worker, client, and timesheet data is stored and managed via Google Sheets.

The app frontend allows workers to sign up, log timesheets, and view payroll details.

Google Sheets remains fully synchronized with the app, allowing two-way data updates.

Our bookkeeper can manually update the Google Sheets database, and changes should be reflected in the app in real time.

If updating the existing app proves too difficult, we are open to developing a new version based on the current functionality, but with an improved and optimized backend using Google Sheets.

Scope of Work

Phase 1: Google Sheets Integration & App Update

Migrate the current app backend to Google Sheets.

Maintain current functionality while improving performance and stability.

Ensure that all app data (workers, clients, timesheets) is stored in structured Google Sheets tables.

Implement two-way synchronization between Google Sheets and the app.

Maintain existing timesheet calculations (overtime, night shifts, etc.) without rebuilding formulas.

Ensure payroll calculations and invoicing processes remain intact but operate directly from Google Sheets.

Optimize existing automation to reduce manual copy-pasting by our bookkeeper.

Phase 2: Future Developments (Optional, Long-Term Collaboration)

Email Automation: Implement MailerLite API integration for automated email sequences.

Contract Automation: Use SignNow API to automate contract submissions.

AI Agent Deployment: Develop AI agents to analyze worker data and assist in decision-making.

Chatbot Integration: Integrate with Chatbase or another chatbot that can read data in real time and provide workers with relevant information.

Further System Enhancements: Additional automation features to streamline labor hire operations.

Requirements

Proven experience in app development and backend integration.

Strong knowledge of Google Sheets API and real-time data synchronization.

Experience using AI tools for coding efficiency.

Ability to optimize processes while maintaining quality.

Experience with API integrations (MailerLite, SignNow, Chatbase, etc.).

Ability to work with our current designs or adapt to a Figma template.

How to Apply

If you‚Äôre interested in this project, please provide:

Examples of previous work relevant to app development and database integration.

Confirmation that you have the required skills.

Confirmation that you will use AI tools to optimize development speed and cost-effectiveness.

Your estimated timeline and pricing for Phase 1 (Google Sheets integration and app update).

Optional: Your thoughts on future developments and long-term collaboration.

- The project involves creating an application for a company that provides software to local auctioneers and auction houses.
- The application's primary use case is inventory ingestion for heavy equipment brought to auction yards.
- The app aims to bridge the connection between inventory ingestion and catalog availability for online bidding.
- The company lacks expertise in React and React Native, despite having broad software experience.

Technical Challenges and Requirements
- The application must be offline-first due to poor connectivity in remote auction yards and warehouse locations.
- Data synchronization with the cloud is crucial and must be resilient to connection interruptions.
- The app uses Realm as a NoSQL database for local storage.
- Initial hydration of the application involves SSO-based or SAML 2 compliant authentication.
- Delta synchronization strategies are employed for new inventory and changes to existing inventory.
- The API is idempotent, allowing repeated application of changes without harming server-side data structures.
- Memory requirements on Android devices are more stringent due to the variety in device quality.

Current Implementation and Issues
- The application assumes entities are Realm entities, with persistence directly queried in some locations.
- Realm is used for both key-value and deeper level storage, including authentication, user data, and SAML 2 tokens.
- During beta testing, only 7 out of 67 pictures taken of one piece of equipment were successfully uploaded to storage.
- The developer suspects issues with object listening or state invalidation that require expertise in React Native to resolve.

Proposed Solutions and Development Approach
- The new developer suggests implementing a sync queue to store pending changes of Realm objects.
- Each entry in the sync queue will track its status (pending, in progress, failed).
- The sync logic will process the queue when the network is available, marking items as successful or retrying with a backoff strategy.
- Realm transactions will ensure data integrity during synchronization.
- Component lifecycles will be tied to Realm objects via subscriptions to prevent React Native errors when objects are deleted.

Work Style and Communication
- The developer typically works on an EST schedule, available from 9 AM to 5 or 6 PM.
- Daily updates and progress videos will be provided.
- The project uses an Expo system for receiving changes and providing new builds.
- Commits should be small and targeted, avoiding large refactors with numerous changes.

It combines elements from Forest app and Focus Tree, with a more streamlined interface. Users can block social media apps and engage in focus sessions using timers, stopwatches, or the Pomodoro technique. During these sessions, they plant virtual flowers on hexagonal plots in their garden. The hexagonal tiles represent honeycomb cells. Successful focus sessions earn users virtual coins, which can be used to unlock new flowers and background sounds. In-app purchases allow users to buy a necatr that triples their coin earnings.

The app includes social features similar to Instagram, where users can follow others, like and comment on their gardens, and invite friends to group planting sessions. If users lose focus, their flowers wither, but these can be removed using coins. The app displays daily motivational quotes upon opening.

The interface should be clean and intuitive, addressing the complexity issues found in similar apps. Users can track their progress daily, weekly, or monthly, viewing how their garden grows and diversifies. Rare flowers are more expensive to unlock.

Monetization options include a one-time purchase for lifetime access (approximately $9 USD) or a free version where users earn fewer coins per focus session. The paid version offers significantly more coins per session, enhancing the user's ability to unlock content.

The app needs to prompt users to capture all required information, one photo at a time.

For example, the amount of ducts/pipes at each end of the pit/manhole.

On top of capturing this information in the photo, there will be check boxes to identify specific information.

On top of this, I would like the app to generate a sheet that documents and draws up that information, providing an overall pit/manhole layout.

I have sample sheets to show how these final sheets should look, and ideas on how we could capture this information accurately and easily.

The photos would need to save directly onto the phone being used, on the app, and potentially directly  onto a selected folder.

If you see the attached, you will see the required information and the samples of the Manhole Sheets.

I have ideas on how I would see this being a useful tool, but I'm open to suggestions.

Is it possible to take a photo of the end of a pit or manhole, then have options to select certain ducts on the pit wall, and flag them as a certain size, and also what remaining capacity they have?

If you look at the photo attached, you will see the side of a manhole with multiple ducts. These vary in size and remaining capacity.  

I imagine being able to click a duct on the photo, then click a check box that specifies a size and another that specifies a remaining capacity (what can still fit in the duct, with what's already there)

By doing this, the collected info can be generated onto a Manhole Sheet as per the attached example?

Question: If your code sample interacts with third-party APIs (e.g., external data sources or payment gateways), how do you organize and manage these integrations? Do you use specific packages (e.g., Dio, http) or architectural patterns (e.g., repository pattern)? Please provide an example of how API calls are structured and handled in your project.

Question: How do you organize and load assets such as images, fonts, or JSON files in your Flutter projects? Can you share an example from your code sample that demonstrates how you reference and use assets within the app (e.g., in widgets or configuration files)?

The platform should allow users to complete geolocated challenges, earn points and badges, and see their ranking on a global leaderboard.
I understand that a web app is more cost-effective than a native mobile app (Android/iOS), but if possible, I would love to receive a quotation for both. My priority is to start with the web app, and if it gains traction, I would like to complement it with a mobile app.
üîπ Main Requirements:
‚úÖ User Registration/Login: Email, Google, Facebook, TikTok.
‚úÖ User Profile: Photo, name, counter of completed challenges, points, earned badges, and a summary of transportation methods used (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Challenge System: A predefined list of challenges created by me or premium users, categorized by type and location.
‚úÖ Statistics Section: Similar to Polarsteps, users should be able to see personalized travel stats, including:
‚Ä¢ Number of challenges completed
‚Ä¢ % of each open challenge completed
‚Ä¢ Total locations visited
‚Ä¢ Distance traveled
‚Ä¢ Number of different transportation methods used
‚Ä¢ Most visited countries/cities
‚Ä¢ Etc.
‚úÖ Bulk Challenge Upload: I already have 1,000 challenge locations in Mexico, and the system must allow easy mass uploads, as the number of locations will continue to grow with each new country and challenge category I add. This should be considered in terms of database scalability and performance.
‚úÖ Challenge Proof Submission: Users must upload at least one photo per challenge location.
‚úÖ Automatic Approval: Challenges should be auto-approved, but with an option for manual moderation if necessary.
‚úÖ Points and Badges: Each destination will grant points, and upon reaching specific milestones, users will earn collectible badges.
‚úÖ Open Check-in: Users should be able to check in at any location on the map, but badges can only be earned by completing the predefined challenges.
‚úÖ Ranking and Gamification: A global and city-based leaderboard based on earned points.
‚úÖ Geolocated Challenges: Users must physically visit designated locations to complete challenges.
‚úÖ Challenges Without a Specific Location: I need the ability to add challenges that don‚Äôt require a fixed location, such as:
‚Ä¢ Trying a specific dish
‚Ä¢ Skydiving
‚Ä¢ Rafting
‚Ä¢ Hiking or trekking
‚úÖ Transport Mode Selection: Users should specify how they arrived at the location (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Monetization:
‚Ä¢ Phase 1: Integration with AdSense and premium subscriptions.
‚Ä¢ Phase 2: Expansion to sponsorships, collaborations, and merchandise.
‚úÖ Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop, with an adventurous style similar to Polarsteps.
‚úÖ Multilanguage Support: The platform should support multiple languages from the start.
‚úÖ Easy Management: I need to be able to add new challenges, moderate content, and manage basic daily operations.
‚úÖ Training: I will need assistance learning how to manage the platform after launch.
‚úÖ International Expansion: I already have example challenges in Mexico, but I am preparing challenges for other countries.
üîπ Example Challenge Categories (Mexico):
These will serve as a model for expanding challenges to other countries:
1. Pueblos M√°gicos ‚Äì Culturally and historically significant towns.
2. Pre-Hispanic Mexico ‚Äì Archaeological sites and pre-Hispanic heritage zones.
3. Mexico‚Äôs Beaches & Coasts ‚Äì Popular coastal destinations.
4. Blue Mexico ‚Äì Lagoons, rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.
5. Green Mexico ‚Äì Natural reserves, mountains, forests, and ecological parks.
6. Mexico‚Äôs Capital Cities ‚Äì Major state capitals.
7. Famous Roads ‚Äì Iconic travel routes, especially for motorcyclists.
8. Mexican Landmarks ‚Äì Monuments and emblematic sites across cities.
9. Gastronomy ‚Äì Destinations famous for their traditional food.
10. Scenic Routes ‚Äì Roads with breathtaking views ideal for road trips.

üîπ Quotation Request:
I would like to know:
‚Ä¢ Your development proposal (recommended technologies and approach).
‚Ä¢ Estimated delivery time for the project.
‚Ä¢ Total cost based on the described functionalities.
‚Ä¢ Your post-launch support options (if available).
‚Ä¢ Payment terms: How would payments be structured (upfront, milestone-based, upon completion, etc.)?
‚Ä¢ Quotation for a mobile app (Android/iOS) in case I decide to complement the web app in the future.
Please send me a detailed quotation along with any recommendations you might have.

The MJPEG frame does not contain the correct SOI (Start of Image) ‚Äî the first two bytes, which should be 0xFF and 0xD8 respectively. In our case, SOI: 00 means that the first byte points to an incorrect SO

Sometimes a frame can be corrupted due to unstable communication or other factors that can corrupt its structure. It will be necessary to buffer several frames and only then pass them for decoding. This can help to assemble the frame from several parts.

Version 1.0 is already halfway done‚Äîwe need faster progress without sacrificing quality.
Version 2.0 development will start soon, and we want a structured, high-quality approach.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Long-Term Opportunities

Beyond this project, we have ambitious plans for future updates (Version 3.0+), an Android version, and additional advanced scouting and analytics features.

Milestones & Payment:
The development process will be divided into two milestones with the following payment structure:

+First Milestone (20%): At the end of the first phase, which includes the initial version of the game (basic mechanics, game flow, and initial ad integration).
+Second Milestone (80%): Upon the final delivery of the game (full app functionality, tested, and ready for deployment on app stores).

Timeline:
Project Duration: The app should be completed and fully functional within 3 months.

Additional Notes:
Testing: You will be responsible for thoroughly testing the game and fixing any bugs.
Budget: The budget is tight, so efficiency and cost-effectiveness are crucial.
Communication: Regular updates on progress are expected throughout the development process.
Ad Integration: The app's monetization through ads is a key priority, so ads should be integrated seamlessly.

- Relay take-off, landing, return-to-home (RTH) and virtual stick commands from a remote server to the drone.
- Forward the realtime video feed and telemetry data from the drone through gRPC to the server.
- Integrate gRPC and Protobuf definitions provided for the communication protocol.
- Each command is valid for 100ms. A new command received should replace the current command immediately. After a command is expired the sticks are expected to return to the neutral position to make the drone hover.
- The application UI is minimal
    - A text field to enter the remote gRPC server URL. This should be persisted across app restarts and allow pasting of URLs.
    - The app connection status to the drone controller.
- Ensure reliable and low-latency communication between the server and the drone.
- Collaborate with our team to test and refine the application for optimal performance and stability.
- Support gRPC connections over SSL for security.
- There is no need to implement any authentication.
- Please include a simple Go gRPC server to test your implementation. It is sufficient if it makes the drone take off, issue a few stick commands, saves the video frames to a file and lands the drone. Please also test the command expiry logic.

prevention.
Creating an accessible and user-friendly app or IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system for
preeclampsia involves a few key components that ensure the information is both accurate and
easily understood by a diverse audience. Here‚Äôs a structured approach to designing such a
system:
1. Target Audience
‚Ä¢ Primary Users: Pregnant individuals, family members, healthcare providers, and
caregivers.
‚Ä¢ Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to individuals with different needs, such
as visual impairments (through screen readers) and hearing impairments (with
transcripts or visual cues).
2. Core Features for the App/IVR System
Information Sections
‚Ä¢ Symptoms of Preeclampsia:
o Clear, simple explanations of common symptoms (high blood pressure, swelling,
protein in urine, headaches, visual disturbances, etc.).
o Use of simple, everyday language and audio-visual elements (in the app) like
images and infographics.
o Interactive Q&A for personalized symptom checking (for apps).
‚Ä¢ Risk Factors:
o List common risk factors (high blood pressure, age, first pregnancy, multiple
pregnancies, etc.).
o Explanation of when users should contact a doctor (in case of risk factor
identification).
‚Ä¢ Lifestyle Guidance:
o Healthy living tips during pregnancy (nutrition, exercise, stress management).
o Guidelines for monitoring and controlling blood pressure.
o Recommendations for rest and hydration.
‚Ä¢ Prevention:
o Overview of how preeclampsia can be prevented or mitigated through lifestyle
and medical care.
o Encouragement to attend regular prenatal checkups.
Personalization (for the app):
‚Ä¢ Allow users to input their age, health conditions, and pregnancy details to get
personalized information or alerts.
‚Ä¢ A checklist for ongoing health monitoring (e.g., blood pressure, swelling, etc.).
Emergency Alerts & Support:
‚Ä¢ Clear instructions on when to seek immediate medical help.
‚Ä¢ Easy access to emergency contact numbers, or the ability to connect directly to a
medical professional through the app or IVR system.
3. Designing for Accessibility
For the App:
‚Ä¢ Text-to-Speech: Use text-to-speech technology to allow users to listen to the
information.
‚Ä¢ Large Font and High Contrast Mode: Include options for users to adjust text size and
contrast for easier reading.
‚Ä¢ Multilingual Support: Provide translations for non-English-speaking users, if necessary.
‚Ä¢ Voice Commands: Allow users to navigate the app using voice commands (useful for
users with physical impairments).
‚Ä¢ Clear Navigation: Use simple, intuitive icons, large buttons, and concise wording.
‚Ä¢ Visual Cues: For example, use a color system (green, yellow, red) to indicate the severity
of symptoms or actions to take.
For the IVR System:
‚Ä¢ Simple, Clear Voice Prompts: Use natural, slow-paced speech with minimal jargon.
Use clear prompts like ""Press 1 for symptoms,"" ""Press 2 for risk factors,"" and ""Press 3 for
lifestyle guidance.""
‚Ä¢ Step-by-Step Guidance: Break down information into small chunks and provide the
option to repeat or go back.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: If users enter an incorrect option, provide a friendly prompt to guide
them back to the main menu.
‚Ä¢ Accessible for Hearing Impaired: Provide an option to switch to text-based support, or
allow users to request a call-back from a healthcare professional.
4. User Experience (UX) Design
‚Ä¢ Easy Navigation: Whether in the app or IVR, users should be able to easily navigate and
find the information they need without feeling overwhelmed.
‚Ä¢ Engaging and Reassuring Tone: Keep the language empathetic and supportive. For
example, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help you stay healthy during your pregnancy.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Regular Updates: Offer push notifications or voice prompts for important reminders,
like prenatal checkups or self-monitoring tips.
‚Ä¢ Progress Tracking: Allow users to log their symptoms or health data (like blood
pressure) and track progress over time.
5. Content Development
‚Ä¢ Accurate Information: Collaborate with obstetricians, gynecologists, and healthcare
professionals to ensure all information provided is medically accurate and evidencebased.
‚Ä¢ Simple Language: Use plain language that is easy for the general public to understand.
‚Ä¢ Multimedia Integration: In the app, include videos, images, and audio descriptions for
complex information.
‚Ä¢ Regular Review and Update: Medical guidelines change, so ensure the app or IVR is
regularly updated to reflect new research or guidelines.
6. Integration with Healthcare Providers
‚Ä¢ Direct Connection: Allow users to share information directly with their healthcare
providers (through the app) or connect with a doctor through the IVR system.
‚Ä¢ Notifications for Healthcare Providers: The app could alert a healthcare provider if a
user logs concerning symptoms.
7. Data Privacy and Security
‚Ä¢ Compliance: Ensure the app and IVR system follow relevant health privacy laws (like
HIPAA in the U.S.) to protect user data.
‚Ä¢ Secure Communication: Any sharing of health data should be encrypted and secure.
8. Testing and Feedback
‚Ä¢ User Testing: Conduct usability testing with pregnant individuals from diverse
backgrounds to ensure the app or IVR system is easy to use and accessible.
‚Ä¢ Feedback Mechanism: Allow users to provide feedback so the system can continuously
improve based on real-world use.
9. Promotion and Awareness
‚Ä¢ Work with healthcare providers, maternity centers, and public health organizations to
promote the app/IVR system to those who may benefit the most.
Great! Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the UX/UI design and some technical aspects, as well as sample
content for the app. These areas will help bring the vision for your accessible and user-friendly
app/IVR system to life.
1. UX/UI Design for the App
Key Principles for UX/UI Design:
‚Ä¢ Simplicity & Minimalism: Avoid clutter. Focus on easy-to-follow steps and a clear,
intuitive interface.
‚Ä¢ Clear and Consistent Navigation: Use familiar icons and easy-to-understand language.
Minimize the number of steps a user needs to take to access information.
‚Ä¢ Responsive Design: Ensure that the app works well on a range of devices and screen
sizes (smartphones, tablets).
‚Ä¢ Empathetic and Supportive Tone: Use language that is gentle, reassuring, and nonintimidating.
UI Components to Focus On:
‚Ä¢ Home Screen:
o Primary Navigation: Buttons for each main section (Symptoms, Risk Factors,
Prevention, Lifestyle Tips, My Health). Use large, easy-to-tap buttons with high
contrast (for visibility).
o Urgency Indicator: A prominent button or alert for ""Emergency Symptoms"" that
quickly connects the user to emergency resources or advice.
o Progress Tracking: A section that shows the user‚Äôs recent activity (e.g.,
symptoms logged, upcoming checkups) with friendly reminders like ‚ÄúYour next
appointment is tomorrow.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Symptom Checker Screen:
o Step-by-Step Guide: Let users input symptoms through yes/no questions or
checkboxes. For instance:
ÔÇß ""Do you have swelling in your hands or feet?""
ÔÇß ""Have you had any severe headaches recently?""
o Based on the answers, the system provides a risk level (e.g., low, moderate, high)
and gives personalized advice. Keep this clear and action-oriented: ‚ÄúIf you are
experiencing severe headaches, contact your healthcare provider immediately.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Information Cards:
o Symptoms, Risk Factors, Prevention: Each topic (e.g., Symptoms) could be
broken down into short, digestible cards that provide brief explanations. For
example, for ""Swelling,"" the card could read:
ÔÇß Title: ""Swelling""
ÔÇß Text: ""Swelling of the face, hands, or feet may be a sign of preeclampsia.
Monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if swelling occurs
rapidly or is accompanied by other symptoms.""
ÔÇß Action Button: ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù (Expands for more details).
‚Ä¢ Audio Features:
o Text-to-Speech: Each card or information section should have an option to be
read aloud. Include a button for this function next to the text.
o Adjustable Speech Speed: Some users may prefer slower or faster speech
rates. Include this option in the settings.
‚Ä¢ Emergency Call Button: Always present in the top-right or bottom-right corner of the
screen as a floating action button. When tapped, it should either dial emergency
services or display emergency information.
Color Scheme & Accessibility Considerations:
‚Ä¢ High Contrast: Use high contrast colors like dark text on a light background (or vice
versa) to improve readability for people with visual impairments.
‚Ä¢ Color-blind Friendly: Use color schemes that are friendly for users with color blindness
(e.g., red-green colorblind users) by incorporating patterns or text labels along with
colors to convey meaning.
‚Ä¢ Adjustable Font Sizes: Include an option in settings for users to change text size
according to their needs.
2. Technical Aspects
Tech Stack (for the app):
‚Ä¢ Frontend:
o React Native (for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android).
o Flutter (another option for cross-platform development).
o Expo (a framework for React Native to simplify the development process).
‚Ä¢ Backend:
o Node.js with Express (to build the server that manages user data, symptom
tracking, etc.).
o Firebase (for real-time database, authentication, push notifications).
‚Ä¢ Database:
o MongoDB or Firestore (for storing health-related user data securely).
o PostgreSQL (an alternative relational database).
‚Ä¢ APIs:
o Text-to-Speech API (like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or AWS Polly).
o Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications on checkups,
medication reminders, etc.).
Security and Privacy:
‚Ä¢ End-to-End Encryption: For any personal data (like health information), use encryption
to secure communication between the app and the server.
‚Ä¢ HIPAA Compliance: Ensure the app complies with healthcare privacy laws like HIPAA (if
targeting the U.S.) for managing personal health data.
‚Ä¢ User Consent: Obtain clear user consent for data collection, with the option to withdraw
consent at any time.
IVR System Considerations:
‚Ä¢ Technology Stack:
o Twilio: A popular platform for building IVR systems, capable of handling voice
prompts, user input, and connecting users to live agents or emergency services.
o Dialogflow (Google Cloud): To handle conversational AI within the IVR system for
more dynamic, natural conversations.
o Amazon Connect: An alternative for building IVR systems with integration for
advanced voice interactions.
‚Ä¢ Flow Design:
o Main Menu: ‚ÄúWelcome to the preeclampsia support system. Press 1 to learn
about symptoms, 2 for risk factors, 3 for lifestyle tips, or press 9 for emergency
assistance.‚Äù
o Submenu for Symptoms: After pressing 1: ‚ÄúDo you experience headaches?
Press 1 for Yes, Press 2 for No. Based on your answer, the system provides a
simple message and recommendation, guiding the user to the next prompt.‚Äù
o Emergency Option: ‚ÄúIf you are experiencing a medical emergency, press 9 to
connect with a healthcare provider or emergency services.‚Äù
3. Sample Content
Symptom Explanation (in-app):
‚Ä¢ Headaches: ""A headache that doesn‚Äôt go away or is unusually severe could be a sign of
preeclampsia. This may be accompanied by visual changes, such as blurred vision or
seeing spots. If you experience these symptoms, it's important to contact your
healthcare provider immediately.""
‚Ä¢ Swelling: ""Mild swelling of the feet or hands is common in pregnancy. However, sudden
swelling in the face or hands, especially if accompanied by severe headaches or vision
changes, could be a sign of preeclampsia.""
Risk Factor Explanation:
‚Ä¢ Pre-existing Hypertension: ""If you have a history of high blood pressure, you may be at a
higher risk of developing preeclampsia. Monitoring your blood pressure regularly during
pregnancy is important.""
Lifestyle Guidance:
‚Ä¢ Nutrition: ""Eating a balanced diet, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole
grains, can help you manage blood pressure and stay healthy during pregnancy.""
‚Ä¢ Rest: ""Make sure to rest when needed, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a healthcare
provider if you feel unwell.""
4. Sample Screen Flow for the App
1. Home Screen:
o Welcome message: ‚ÄúWelcome to the Preeclampsia Support App. How can we
assist you today?‚Äù
o Buttons: Symptoms, Risk Factors, Prevention, Lifestyle Tips, Track My Health,
Emergency
2. Symptom Checker (if ‚ÄúSymptoms‚Äù is selected):
o Step 1: ""Do you have a headache?""
ÔÇß Yes ‚û° Proceed to next question.
ÔÇß No ‚û° Move to the next symptom.
o Step 2: ""Do you have swelling in your hands or feet?""
ÔÇß Continue based on user input.
ÔÇß Provide recommendations based on answers.
3. Emergency Alert Screen:
o Clear emergency number or call button.
o Text: ""If you experience any of these symptoms, please contact a healthcare
provider immediately.""",$15.00,$35.00,"['$15.00', '$35.00', '']",Intermediate,"['Odoo Development', 'Python', 'PostgreSQL', 'MySQL', 'Full-Stack Development', 'React Native', 'Android', 'React', 'Node.js', 'Bootstrap', 'XHTML', 'Next.js', 'Web Design', 'Odoo', 'MongoDB', 'Flutter', 'ExpressJS']",5 to 10,2.0,0.0,0.0,$1.3K,1-3 months,More than 30 hrs/week,8.0,1.0,,

android_developer,Build a step counter native module for React Native / Expo,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-step-counter-native-module-for-React-Native-Expo_~021896473918892601040/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Fixed-price,Denmark,"I am looking for a very simple proof-of-concept step counter Expo app for Android phones. The app should display the amount of walked steps per day since it was started the first time. As data source you have to use Android's Sensor API. It is very important that you **DO NOT** use Google Fit or Google Health and solely rely on the value you can obtain through the Android's Sensor API (https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_motion)

**You should write a Native Module** that reads the step count via the Sensor API and makes that value available to Expo to render it on screen. Render the value centered on the screen. Black text on a white background. No need to spend time on styling, splash screen, graphics, app icon, upload to Google Play etc., as I am **ONLY** interested in the way how to access the step count from Expo.

You have to use the latest version of Expo and Kotlin (**VERY IMPORTANT**). Expo has simplified the way to create native modules through their Expo Modules API, so this link is a good starting point: https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/

## Deliveries
- Source code for the step counter app (as described above)

## Requirements
- Write your **own** native module to read the step count from the Android Sensor API
- **DO NOT** use the Google Fit or Google Health API
- **DO NOT** use the Expo Pedometer API as it is broken on Android (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/9463)
- From TypeScript you should be able to call your native module via a function like `getCurrentStepCount()` to retrieve that value. Call that function within a `setInterval()` every 5 seconds
- 1 screen showing the current step count per day on a white background in the center and nothing else, e.g. ""2025-03-01: 8.666 steps | 2025-03-02: 7.653 steps | etc.""
- When the app is terminated by the user or the Android OS the step counting has to keep working.
- **DO NOT** use a Foreground Service to avoid getting terminated by the OS, as I do not want to show a notification on screen all the time (+ it drains the battery)
- Your proof of concept app should get the current step count from the Sensor API and persist it to storage  every 15 minutes, so when the app is opened you can attribute the walked steps to the respective day. Image you do not open the app for 3 days and you still want to know how many steps where walked on each day.

The app supports users by streamlining text documentation for a third-party web system. The current app records notes via our website, transcribes them using the Deepgram API, processes them with OpenAI GPT prompts for formatting, and imports the text into the third-party system‚Äôs web fields via a Chrome extension. We need this functionality to work on mobile devices (iPhone, Android, tablets) that don‚Äôt support Chrome extensions, while retaining all features, including automated field imports and a secondary ""starter phrases"" tool.

Current Workflow:

Recording & Processing: Users record notes on our website. The audio is transcribed via Deepgram API, then processed by OpenAI GPT (via multiple prompts) to sort and rewrite the text for compatibility with the target system. Processed texts are saved and organized by date for users to import.
Text Import: On the third-party web system, users click the Chrome extension icon in the browser toolbar, opening a popup with a sorted list of transcribed texts. Selecting an entry auto-fills relevant text fields, and based on the text content, it may interact with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., checking an option or selecting from a list).
Starter Phrases: With the extension installed, small icons appear in the system‚Äôs text boxes. Users click these to save or insert pre-defined ""starter phrases"" for rapid input.
Project Goals:

Build a PWA that replicates the recording, transcription, and processing workflow.
Replace the Chrome extension with a bookmarklet that works on mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome), displaying a floating overlay with sorted transcribed texts for import into the target system‚Äôs fields.
Ensure the bookmarklet can auto-fill multiple text fields, trigger checkboxes, and select dropdowns based on text content.
Adapt the ""starter phrases"" feature for mobile, either via the bookmarklet overlay or a similar mechanism.
Optimize for affordability, reliability, and mobile usability (iPhone, Android, tablets).
Key Features:

PWA Interface:
Mobile-friendly UI for recording audio notes (via browser mic access).
Integrate Deepgram API for transcription and OpenAI API for text processing (existing prompts provided).
Store and display processed texts, sorted by date (e.g., ""March 2, 2025: 10:15 AM"").
Cloud syncing (e.g., Firebase) for cross-device access.
Bookmarklet Integration:
On the third-party web system, users trigger a bookmarklet to show a floating overlay with the sorted text list.
Selecting an entry auto-fills text fields (e.g., identified by ""notes"") and interacts with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., identified by ""stable"").
Handle the system‚Äôs HTML structure (will provide sample pages or field IDs if needed).
Starter Phrases:
Replicate the text box icons as a mobile-friendly feature (e.g., overlay buttons or a separate bookmarklet mode).
Allow saving and inserting phrases into the system‚Äôs fields.
Compatibility:
Works on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome), with testing on both.
Fallback to clipboard copy/paste if the system blocks DOM manipulation.
Deliverables:

Fully functional PWA hosted on a platform like Vercel or Firebase.
Bookmarklet script with overlay UI for integration with the target system.
Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
Testing report confirming functionality on iPhone and Android with the third-party system.

Skills Required:

Web Development: Strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, or vanilla JS).
PWA Experience: Proven experience building Progressive Web Apps with responsive design, Service Workers, and offline capabilities.
Bookmarklet/DOM Manipulation: Familiarity with writing bookmarklets or scripts to interact with third-party website DOMs (e.g., querySelector, event triggers).
API Integration: Experience with REST APIs (e.g., Deepgram, OpenAI) for audio transcription and text processing.
Mobile Browser Compatibility: Knowledge of Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) quirks, including Clipboard API and mic access.
Database/Storage: Basic experience with cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) or local storage (IndexedDB).
Debugging: Ability to troubleshoot cross-browser issues and security restrictions (e.g., CSP).",$10.00,$50.00,"['$10.00', '$50.00', '']",Expert,"['AI App Development', 'AI Model Integration', 'HTML', 'Web Development', 'Payment Gateway Integration', 'CSS', 'Full-Stack Development', 'React', 'WordPress', 'WooCommerce', 'AI Agent Development', 'Web Application', 'PHP', 'JavaScript']",50+,3.0,0.0,0.0,$13K,3-6 months,Less than 30 hrs/week,2.0,0.0,Health & Fitness,Individual client

A GERD-friendly calorie tracking mobile app designed to help users manage their dietary needs while avoiding trigger foods. The app will feature food logging, GERD-safe food identification, and dietary alignment indicators, ensuring users can make informed food choices. The UI will be modern, clean, and intuitive, with a focus on wellness rather than medical themes.

**Designs for the app have been attached.**

### **What is GERD?**

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and potential damage over time. Common symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing. Managing GERD often involves dietary adjustments to avoid trigger foods that can worsen symptoms. This app helps users make informed food choices to support their digestive health and overall well-being.

### **Technology Stack:**

- **Framework:** React Native (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Backend:** Supabase (for authentication, database management, and API services)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (for personalized food suggestions and GERD-friendly recommendations)
- **Styling:** Tailwind Native (or an equivalent style system for consistency and responsiveness)
- **External APIs:**
    - **USDA FoodData Central API** (for accurate nutritional information)
    - **OpenFoods API** (for barcode scanning and product data retrieval)
    - **OpenAI API** (for AI-powered dietary recommendations)

### **Core Features:**

1. **User Authentication:** Sign-up, login, and profile management using Supabase authentication.
2. **Food Logging:** Users can search and log food entries, tracking calories and nutritional data.
3. **GERD-Friendly Tagging:** A distinct tagging system that highlights GERD-safe and trigger foods.
4. **Dietary Alignment Indicators:** A custom visual system showing how well foods align with GERD dietary needs.
5. **AI-Powered Insights:** Personalized meal recommendations and GERD-related dietary tips powered by OpenAI.
6. **Analytics Dashboard:** Users can view trends, caloric intake, and symptom correlations.
7. **Favorites & Meal Planning:** Save favorite foods and create meal plans based on GERD-friendly options.
8. **Settings & Customization:** Allow users to adjust dietary preferences, notification settings, and tracking goals.
9. **Offline Support:** Enable food logging and basic app functionality without an internet connection.
10. **Push Notifications:** Reminders for meal logging and GERD-specific dietary guidance.
11. **Menu & Barcode Scanning:** Users can scan restaurant menus or packaged food barcodes to quickly identify GERD-friendly options and retrieve nutritional information using USDA and OpenFoods APIs.

### *Write helicopter in the first sentence of your application.

### **Deliverables:**

- Fully functional **React Native app** adhering to the outlined features.
- **Supabase backend** setup with authentication, data storage, and API integration.
- **AI-powered features** using OpenAI API for dietary recommendations.
- Integration with **USDA FoodData Central API** and **OpenFoods API** for food-related data.
- Complete **UI styling** with Tailwind Native or equivalent.
- Source code with proper **documentation** and modular components.
- Deployment guidance and basic post-launch support.

### **Requirements:**

- **Proficiency in React Native** and related libraries.

- **Knowledge of database systems** (SQL/NoSQL).
- **Familiarity with version control** (Git) and CI/CD workflows.
- **Strong problem-solving skills** and attention to detail.
- **Excellent communication skills** and ability to work in a team.

### **You Should Have:**

The app will be tested on our farm initially, with potential for future expansion. We need a skilled Flutter developer to build a functional version with a specific interface design (see details below) and a basic web dashboard. Most of our team uses iPhones, so iOS support is required. Different sites have different bin sizes, and the app must allow users to choose the appropriate bin capacity. The home screen will list sites for selection, with administrators having the ability to edit or add new sites, including the number of bins and bin sizes, which remain static unless changed by the admin.

Mobile App (Employee View):
‚Ä¢ Home Screen: A list of existing sites (e.g., custom names) for employees to select when reporting feed levels and mortalities.
‚Ä¢ Reporting Screen:
o Single screen after site selection with a simple animated conical bin shape (based on a feed bin design, adjustable for different capacities, e.g., 15-ton default per site configuration).
o 3 drag points (red dots) to adjust the feed level interactively, with a yellow shaded area indicating the feed level.
o Real-time calculation of feed tons (e.g., 1.5T) and remaining capacity (e.g., 13.5T) based on the site‚Äôs configured bin size.
o Text display: Bin Name (e.g., Bin #1), selected Capacity (e.g., 15T), and calculations (e.g., ""Empty Space: 1.5T, Remaining Feed: 13.5T"").
o Dropdowns for Line (e.g., Line 1) specific to the selected site.
o Date field (auto-filled) and optional Notes text box.
o Mortality Tracking: Below the bin, a dropdown menu for mortality types (e.g., chronic illness, respiratory, flu) and a text box to enter the number of mortalities (e.g., ""1"" for 1 pig).
o Green ""Submit"" button.
‚Ä¢ Support for iOS (primary) and Android (secondary).
Mobile App (Administrator View):
‚Ä¢ Home Screen: Same list of sites as employees, plus an ""Admin"" button or option.
‚Ä¢ Admin Screen:
o Option to edit existing sites (e.g., update Barn Name, number of bins, bin sizes like 10T, 15T, 20T).
o Option to add new sites with configurable number of bins and bin sizes.
o Changes to bin sizes and numbers remain static unless updated by the admin.
o Simple form with save functionality, syncing to Firebase.
‚Ä¢ Admin access restricted (e.g., password or role-based login).
Web Dashboard (Farm Owner View):
‚Ä¢ Basic table listing submissions (Barn Name, Line, Date, Feed Tons, Remaining Tons, Status, Mortality Details) with thumbnails of the bin graphic, reflecting the site‚Äôs configured bin size.
‚Ä¢ Clickable details to view the adjusted bin shape, notes, mortality type, number of deaths, and status.
‚Ä¢ Status toggle (Pending/Ordered).
‚Ä¢ Admin option to edit site configurations (same as mobile admin screen).
Technical Details:
‚Ä¢ Use Firebase for real-time data syncing between mobile and web.
‚Ä¢ Target iOS primarily (delivered as .ipa file), with Android (.apk) as a secondary option.
‚Ä¢ Simple, functional design based on the attached reference image (conical bin with 3 drag points).
‚Ä¢ Implement a site setup feature to assign different bin sizes (e.g., 10T, 15T, 20T) and number of bins per site, editable only by admins.
‚Ä¢ Store site configurations, bin data, and mortality data in Firebase.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Working mobile app (iOS .ipa and Android .apk) with employee and admin modes.
‚Ä¢ Web dashboard.
‚Ä¢ Source code with comments.
‚Ä¢ Basic testing and bug fixes on iOS.
Timeline
‚Ä¢ Estimated 70-100 hours over 3-4 weeks.
‚Ä¢ Milestones:
o 25% upfront upon contract signing.
o 50% after mobile app completion (iOS focus).
o 25% after web dashboard and final testing.
Budget
‚Ä¢ $3,500 - $5,000 total, negotiable based on experience and timeline.
‚Ä¢ Prefer fixed-price, but open to hourly (max $50/hour).
How to Apply
‚Ä¢ Submit a proposal with:
o Brief overview of your Flutter experience.
o Link to portfolio (e.g., GitHub, app demos).
o Estimated timeline and cost within the budget.
o Any questions or suggestions for the project.
‚Ä¢ Attach or reference the provided image for design inspiration.
Notes
‚Ä¢ This is a prototype for internal testing. Future phases may include additional features (e.g., feed mill integration, Spanish language support).
‚Ä¢ Ownership and Confidentiality: The client will own all intellectual property rights to the deliverables upon full payment. The freelancer agrees to transfer all rights and keep project details confidential, with no reuse or disclosure without prior written consent.

Build an app that has 20 names stored in it. The names are composed of first and last names. Names are Arabic and English. Both of which are written using English letters.

How it works:
I will call the app using a wake up word
App responds by saying yes
I will tell the app to add or remove or modify a name
The app will ask me which name i want to perform the function on.
I will give it the name.
It will print the name for me.

ADB Command-Line Knowledge: Familiarity with common ADB command-line operations and scripts. For example, you should know how to use commands like adb shell, adb devices, adb install, etc., within automation scripts to perform device actions beyond the UI automation.
Database Logging: Experience integrating test automation with databases. Ability to connect to PostgreSQL/MySQL from Java, and insert or update records (such as test results or logs) programmatically. Knowledge of JDBC or ORM tools for Java is a plus.
Problem-Solving & Optimization: Strong debugging skills to troubleshoot issues on different Android devices (OS versions, OEM variations). Ability to optimize performance and memory usage of the test runs, ensuring the solution scales with multiple devices.
Project Details

Timeline: The project is expected to be completed within 1‚Äì2 weeks from the start date. This includes development, testing on multiple devices, and delivering a fully functional solution.
Fixed-Price Contract: This job is a fixed-price project. Payment will be tied to successful delivery of the device management automation system as per the requirements. (You can specify the budget or range here if desired.)
Deliverables: A working automated device management system capable of the above responsibilities, along with documentation (setup instructions, usage guide) and basic test results to demonstrate functionality.
Collaboration: You will be working independently but will have access to our team for questions, clarifications, and any necessary resources. Communication will be via [email/Slack/your tool of choice] and we expect regular updates on progress.
How to Apply
