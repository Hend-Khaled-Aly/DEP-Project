Flask Expert Needed,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Flask-Expert-Needed_~021898401456472145018/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Fixed-price,Worldwide,"I need a flask expert that can follow the following criteria for my app

Flask App Checklist for High Scalability (1000+ Users Concurrently)
1. Code Structure & Maintainability
(Flask is more lightweight than Django, so we need to structure it well to avoid a messy monolith.)
✔️ Use Flask Blueprints for modularity (e.g., users/, billing/, credits/, api/).
✔️ Separate files for routes, models, authentication, and utilities (Flask doesn’t enforce structure like Django).
✔️ Follow Flask best practices: Use application factory pattern to allow flexible configurations.
✔️ Avoid monolithic code by keeping reusable functions in utils/ and moving business logic outside routes.
✔️ Decouple services where possible (e.g., separate worker processes for background tasks).
✅ How it helps:
Prevents spaghetti code that slows down scaling efforts.
Ensures new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.

2. Database Optimization (PostgreSQL)
(Using SQLAlchemy ORM instead of Django’s ORM.)
✔️ Use SQLAlchemy ORM (or Flask-SQLAlchemy) for database interaction.
✔️ Manually create indexes (Index('index_name', Model.field)) since Flask doesn’t auto-index like Django.
✔️ Use SQLAlchemy connection pooling (pool_pre_ping=True, pool_size=20, max_overflow=0).
✔️ Implement Redis/Memcached caching (e.g., Flask-Caching).
✔️ Prevent N+1 query problems by using joinedload() in SQLAlchemy.
✔️ Read Replicas: Set up read replicas to distribute database read requests.
✅ How it helps:
Optimized queries allow faster responses under high load.
Connection pooling prevents too many open database connections.
Redis caching reduces database calls, improving response times.

3. Multi-User Support (1000+ Concurrent Users)
(Flask handles sessions differently than Django.)
✔️ Use Flask-Session to store session data in Redis instead of the database.
✔️ Generate unique session IDs and store them in Redis for fast lookups.
✔️ Use Celery + Redis for async tasks (e.g., processing outputs, deleting old data).
✔️ Paginate large dataset queries using Flask-SQLAlchemy’s pagination methods.
✔️ Rate limit requests per user/IP to prevent abuse and API overload.
✔️ Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple Flask instances behind a load balancer.
✅ How it helps:
Redis prevents database session overload, making Flask faster under heavy load.
Load balancing distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers.
Rate limiting protects against DDoS attacks and server abuse.

4. AWS S3 Bucket (Input/Output Storage)
✔️ Store all user-generated content in S3 using boto3.
✔️ Use pre-signed URLs for secure file uploads/downloads.
✔️ Implement lifecycle policies for automatic old file deletion.
✔️ Restrict S3 permissions (ensure private access).
✔️ Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster file uploads/downloads globally.
✅ How it helps:
No server storage needed, reducing system load.
Scalable storage solution that handles millions of files.
Faster access to files globally with S3 Transfer Acceleration.

5. Payments & Credit-Based System (Stripe)
✔️ Integrate Stripe API with Flask (stripe-python package).
✔️ Implement credit deduction logic only after successful processing.
✔️ Build a billing history table in PostgreSQL.
✔️ Admin panel for manual credit adjustments (use Flask-Admin or a custom dashboard).
✔️ Log failed payment attempts for debugging.
✅ How it helps:
Prevents fraudulent use of credits.
Ensures users get billed correctly even under high load.

6. Security & Protection
✔️ Enforce HTTPS and secure cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True).
✔️ Use Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication.
✔️ Implement rate limiting using Flask-Limiter.
✔️ Enable CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.
✔️ Store API keys & secrets in .env files using python-dotenv.
✔️ Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) for extra protection against attacks.
✅ How it helps:
Prevents API abuse with rate limits.
Protects against unauthorized access and session hijacking.

7. Deployment & Infrastructure (Auto-Scaling)
✔️ Use Gunicorn + Nginx for serving Flask in production.
✔️ Containerize with Docker (docker-compose.yml for easy deployment).
✔️ Enable auto-scaling with AWS ECS/Kubernetes/DigitalOcean Apps.
✔️ Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly.
✔️ Use health checks to detect and restart failing instances.
✅ How it helps:
More instances launch automatically when traffic increases.
Load balancing ensures no single server gets overwhelmed.

8. Logging, Monitoring & Error Tracking
✔️ Use Sentry or Rollbar for real-time error tracking.
✔️ Implement logging for failed payments & user actions.
✔️ Monitor app performance using Prometheus + Grafana.
✔️ Set up alerts for high database usage or downtime.
✔️ Log Celery task failures for debugging async jobs.
✅ How it helps:
Detects issues before they cause downtime.
Tracks high-usage areas to optimize performance.

9. Scheduled Cleanup Script (S3)
✔️ Use a cron job or Celery Beat to delete old files daily.
✔️ Store logs of deleted files for debugging.
✔️ Delete inactive user-generated files to save storage costs.
✅ How it helps:
Reduces unnecessary storage costs.
Keeps the system optimized.

10. Documentation & ReadMe
✔️ Write a README explaining setup & usage.
✔️ Generate API documentation using Flask-Swagger/OpenAPI.
✔️ Add code comments for complex logic.
✔️ Create Postman collections for API testing.
✅ How it helps:
Onboards new developers quickly.
Ensures easy API integration for third-party services.",$100.00 ,,['$100.00'],Entry,"['CSS', 'Web Development', 'MySQL', 'PHP', 'API', 'Flask', 'JavaScript', 'Odoo', 'Node.js', 'Python']",Less than 5,0,0,0,$2.4K,,,79,15,GBR,,

I need help creating a very simple Slack application. While the task itself is straightforward, it may require setting up a server—though I’m open to your suggestions on whether that’s necessary.

I need a developer to implement a button that:

    Saves the edited fields from the message.

We are an Italian startup that is developing a digital hub to promote integrated services in small tourist towns.
Our goal is to create a scalable, cost-efficient, user-friendly WordPress Multisite platform that provides local communities with a booking system, AI chatbots, interactive maps, crowdfunding features, and a centralized e-commerce solution. Our environment will enable them to manage their own activities with minimal overhead.
We are looking for reliable and highly qualified professionals for long-term collaboration. We do not have a fixed budget; we are open to proposals and will negotiate terms based on approach, scope and deliverables.
Important note: you will only be responsible for system setup, creating robust automation, testing and default templates. Each new customer should automatically get a pre-configured subsite (with relevant functionality) once onboarded. You will not have to manage or change their content on an ongoing basis - our in-house team will handle customer support and configuration after the automated processes are established.
We enjoy to collaborate with freelancers or pre-built teams. Further details about the project will be made known to interested ones.

I have built on Nextjs a platform for actuaries (a niche domain in insurance) and insurance companies,  where actuaries can find missions and insurance companies can find actuaries.
I am now in the phase of implementing the payment process.
Although I already thought about some features like
- the actuary has a interface where he can enter his number of days worked.
- the actuary cannot change his worked day passed a certain time.
- the employer can see how many days the freelancer worked
- the employer can pay the actuary at a fixed frequency, either 2 or 4 weeks (agreed by both the actuary and the employer)
- the employer must send to us some part of the money beforehand. Our platform will act as an escrow payment. This is to ensure trust and reliability to our freelancers. But also for employers who don't pay directly the freelancer even before the mission.
- actuary and employer can dispute and claim refunds

I would like this feature to be built by someone who already implemented this kind of timesheet + payment process as I might have forgotten important things (security issues, features to ensure a smooth ux, etc.)

Initial Price Determination
The current market price is determined and stored as a reference value.

Opening of Base Positions
Two market positions are opened simultaneously:

Sell (Short): A sell position is opened with a fixed amount of x, e.g., 10 units.
Buy (Long): A buy position is also opened with x, e.g., 10 units.
Placement of Initial Limit Orders
Immediately after opening both positions, two limit orders are placed:

Limit Sell: Above the original purchase price, a sell order is placed with an increased price by x, e.g., 0.05. At the same time, the order size is increased by x, e.g., 10%, resulting in 11 units.
Limit Buy: Below the original selling price, a buy order is placed with a reduced price by x, e.g., 0.05, also with an increased size by x, e.g., 10% (e.g., from 10 to 11 units).
Dynamic Adjustment of Limit Orders
A continuous check is performed to determine whether any of the limit orders have been executed. Once an execution is detected, the system automatically:

Places a new limit order, increasing its size by x, e.g., 10% compared to the previous order.
Adjusts the price of the new limit order by 0.05 (based on the executed price of the last limit order).
Profit Monitoring and Take-Profit
Simultaneously, the total profit of all open positions is monitored. Based on the ratio of unrealized profit (PnL) to the current position size, the percentage gain is calculated. If this reaches 1%, all open positions are closed.

These steps outline when and how sell (Short) and buy (Long) positions, as well as subsequent limit orders, are placed and adjusted during the trading process.",$25.00 ,$47.00 ,"['$25.00', '$47.00']",Expert,"['react nodes', 'PHP', 'Firebase', 'ExpressJS', 'Node.js', 'React', 'Web Application', 'Java', 'JavaScript']",Less than 5,2,12,6,$90 ,< 1 month,Less than 30 hrs/week,,,CHE,Finance & Accounting,Individual client

*The Problems I’m Facing*

- My current setup has issues that need fixing:

- Too Many Spreadsheets: I use 162 Google Sheets (one per manufacturer, vehicle type, and product type) to track vehicle data and make SKUs. It’s getting harder as I add more vehicles.
- Tricky Vehicle Data: Matching my data (e.g., Mitsubishi L200 with model codes KA4, KB4, etc., and engine codes 4M40, 4D56, etc., from 96-06) to eBay’s list is tough. Their details (e.g., 05-2015, 4M40-A) don’t always match mine.

- Urgent Listings: I need to list 100 items on eBay soon, so I need a fast solution.

- Hard to Scale: Managing files, photos, and eBay compatibility manually won’t work as my collection grows.

- Delivery and Photos: Files need ISOs/ZIPs, and photos (1 disc image, 22-24 product images per item) need better automation.


The project has two phases:
- Short-Term Plan (Next Few Days): Use spreadsheets to list ~100 items on eBay quickly as a test.
- Long-Term Plan (Over Time): Build a strong, automated system step by step, while I keep listing items.


*My Vision*

I want a simple, automated system on TrueNAS that:
- Organizes vehicle data (e.g., make, model, year) for eBay listings.

- Manages product files in Product Library and product photos in -Product_Photos_and_Mockups, with unique SKUs that include a custom hash.

- Creates eBay listings (parent, variation, or standalone) using CSV Files uploaded to 3dsellers, with correct fitment details for cars and motorcycles.

Flutter Developer Needed for Dynamic Homescreen Widget for Streak Display,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Flutter-span-class-highlight-Developer-span-Needed-for-Dynamic-Homescreen-Widget-for-Streak-Display_~021898226549255781498/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Fixed-price,Worldwide,"I am seeking a developer with expertise in native Android and iOS development to create a streak widget for my Flutter-based math application. The widget should closely resemble Duolingo's streak widget in functionality and design.

Key Requirements:

1. Integration with Flutter:

The project is part of a Flutter application.

The background for the home screen widget will be determined in the Flutter code.

Relevant variables (e.g., whether the user has completed their daily lesson) will be supplied, but the backgrounds will not be fetched from the backend.



2. Widget Design & Components:

The widget should include:

A widget background (stored on the frontend).

A streak icon.

Streak text displaying the number of consecutive days (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).


I will provide all widget backgrounds, as well as an example image to illustrate the desired design, including the exact positioning of the streak text, streak icons, and other elements.



3. Dynamic Backgrounds and Icons:

Backgrounds: There will be multiple options for widget backgrounds:

If the user has not completed their daily lesson, the widget should randomly select from five options designated for this state. (I have attached example layouts)

If the user has completed their daily lesson, the widget should randomly select from five different options.


Streak Icon: The streak icon should dynamically change based on whether the user has completed their daily lesson.



4. Conditional Updates:

The streak text color (e.g., 1, 2, 3) should be gray if the user has not completed their daily lesson.

Both the streak icon and the widget background should reflect the completion status of the daily lesson.



5. Live Updates:

The widget must support real-time updates to ensure it reflects changes immediately after a user completes a lesson.

This could involve implementing a listener or similar mechanism to synchronize the widget state dynamically.



6. Confidentiality:

As part of this project, you will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property.




If you are interested and meet these requirements, please reach out. I will provide the necessary resources, including widget backgrounds, example images, and backend variables for the project.



Requirements:  
- Fetch streak and lesson completion status dynamically from the backend whenever the homescreen is opened or updated.  
- The widget should work seamlessly for both iOS and Android platforms.  
- Use any Flutter package necessary to implement the functionality efficiently.  
- Fix Directory Issues: Resolve missing or broken folders in my Android and iOS directories to ensure compatibility with the existing project.  
- Platform Detection: Ensure the app can dynamically detect whether the user is on iOS or Android and use the appropriate native implementation.
Make any necessary changes on the Flutter side to guarantee compatibility and proper integration with platform-specific features.
- Code Responsibility: You will be responsible for making the necessary changes to the Flutter codebase to ensure seamless functionality of the widget.

Deliverables:  
1. Fully functional widget code for both iOS and Android platforms.  
2. Ensure dynamic fetching and updates of streak and lesson completion data.  
3. Fix any issues with my current Android and iOS project directories.  
4. Provide all source code files and ensure compatibility with my existing project.
5. Make the n

Additional Requirements:  
- NDA: You must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before starting the project.  
- Code Ownership: Upon completion and payment, the code will become my property, and you must destroy any copies.  
- Fixed Price: Provide a fixed price for the project.  
- Confidentiality: You are not allowed to share the code or any details of this project with others.  

Preferences:  
- Experience with creating homescreen widgets for Flutter.  
- Strong debugging skills to resolve directory and compatibility issues.  

If you are interested, please share:  
1. Examples of similar work you have done in Flutter.  
2. Your fixed price quote for the project.  
3. Timeline for delivery.

UI Path Developer,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Path-span-class-highlight-Developer-span_~021898217595215900063/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Hourly,Worldwide,"We are looking for an experienced RPA Developer to build an automation solution that integrates with multiple systems of record—such as Yardi, Elite, Happy, and MRI—to extract data. The integration will enable customers to sync with their system of record within their secure environment. The solution will test connectivity using user-provided credentials and automatically download a sample 50058 form to validate that data extraction works as expected.

This project will be based on detailed video walkthroughs and written documentation provided by our team. All testing will be conducted in-house; direct production access will not be granted.

Key Responsibilities:

Develop the RPA Automation Workflow:

Build a solution using a leading RPA platform (preferably UiPath Studio) that replicates the following process:
System Selection:
Provide a dropdown allowing users to choose their system of record (Yardi, Elite, Happy, MRI, Other). For “Other,” display a message that our team will follow up.
Credential & Configuration Input:
Display dynamic form fields for supported systems to capture necessary details such as user ID, password, and any additional connection parameters (e.g., URL/endpoint).
Connectivity Testing:
Implement a “Test Connection” feature to verify that a connection to the selected system can be successfully established.
Data Extraction:
Automatically download a sample 50058 form following a successful connectivity test to ensure that the extraction process functions correctly.
Feedback & Error Handling:
Provide clear success messages or error feedback, with logs to assist in troubleshooting.
Iterative Development:

Develop based on our comprehensive video and written guides.
Deliver initial versions for in-house testing; refine the workflow iteratively based on detailed feedback.
Documentation:

Provide complete, well-documented source code and project files (e.g., UiPath XAML workflows, configuration files).
Include detailed deployment and maintenance instructions.
Participate in a handover session to explain the solution and address any follow-up questions.
Security & Best Practices:

Implement secure coding practices, especially for handling user credentials and sensitive connection data.
Ensure the solution is robust, maintainable, and scalable for future enhancements.
Required Qualifications:

Proven experience in RPA development using tools such as UiPath Studio, Automation Anywhere, or Blue Prism.
Strong background in automating desktop applications and handling UI interactions.
Experience building dynamic workflows with parameterized inputs and connectivity testing.
Excellent problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and robust error handling practices.
Strong communication skills and the ability to work iteratively using detailed documentation and video walkthroughs.
Familiarity with integration projects in secure or regulated environments is a plus.
Project Workflow & Environment:

Documentation-Driven Development:
You will receive detailed video walkthroughs and written guides outlining every step of the process.

No Direct Production Access:
All testing will be performed in-house on the production environment by our team; you will work solely with provided documentation and feedback.

Iterative Feedback Loop:
Develop, deliver, test, and refine the solution until it meets our requirements for both connectivity and data extraction (specifically the automated download of a sample 50058 form).

Future Scalability:
The solution will be designed for repeatability so it can be used across multiple customer environments by simply updating credentials and minor configuration details.

If you are an experienced RPA developer who can work with detailed documentation and deliver a secure, robust automation solution without direct system access, we’d love to hear from you. Please include examples of similar projects in your proposal and a brief description of your approach to handling iterative feedback in a controlled environment.",,,,Expert,"['Graphic Design', 'UiPath', 'Adobe Photoshop', 'Data Scraping', 'API', 'JavaScript', 'Data Mining', 'Python']",10 to 15,3,3,1,$1.2M,< 1 month,Less than 30 hrs/week,176,36,United States,Tech & IT,Mid-sized company (10-99 people)

Update smart fee estimator in custom Dogecoin fork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Update-smart-fee-estimator-custom-Dogecoin-fork_~021898195193973386218/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Hourly,Worldwide,"## Project Overview
I am looking for an experienced C++ blockchain developer to update the fee calculation logic in our custom fork of Dogecoin's codebase to be inline with modern Dogecoin. Our fork was adapted from a much older version of Dogecoin, and so we want you to implement the smart fee calculation and priority system of modern Dogecoin into our fork.

You can see our current code here:
This is the repository you will be modifying!
https://github.com/Flopcoin/Flopcoin

Here is the Dogecoin source code that contains the smart fee system we want:
You can copy over how the fee system works here!
https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin

Currently, the fee calculation functions (particularly in `wallet.cpp`) rely on deprecated or simplistic logic and a fee rate set to 1 FLOP/kB. We want to update our code to implement a more modern smart fee mechanism similar to the one used in modern Dogecoin forks when you can increase or lower the fee based on priority. Additionally, we need to change the fee rate from 1 FLOP/kB to 0.01 FLOP/kB (in line with modern dogecoin).

You will likely be modifying these files:
wallet.h, wallet.cpp, policy.h, policy.cpp

## Key Deliverables
1. Modernize Fee Estimation
   - Update the transaction creation loop in `wallet.cpp` to mimic the iterative fee estimation process described in the provided Dogecoin code.
   - Ensure that the fee is correctly iterated and adjusted until the transaction meets the network policy criteria.

2. Update Fee Calculation Functions
   - Modify the `GetMinimumFee` function in `wallet.cpp` to drop the old smart fee estimation (using mempool.estimateSmartFee) and instead use our internal function `GetRequiredFee`.
   - Update `GetRequiredFee` (or the equivalent function) to compute fees at a rate of 0.01 FLOP per kilobyte, instead of the current 1 FLOP/kB.

3. Testing and Validation
   - Thoroughly test the updated fee system to ensure that transactions are built correctly with the new fee rate.
   - Ensure that fee values comply with change output adjustments, coin selection, and all wallet policies.

4. Documentation  
   - Provide updated documentation or a guide on how the new fee mechanism works.
   - Create inline comments in the code to help future developers understand the changes.

5. Build Updated Wallets  
   - Compile and build the updated core wallets for Linux, Windows, and MacOS

## Required Skills
- Strong experience in C++ and blockchain development.
- Familiarity with cryptocurrency wallet implementations and transaction building.
- Previous experience working with Dogecoin or forking similar blockchain codebases.

## How to Apply

- A brief description of your experience with similar projects.
- Your estimated timeline and cost for completing this project.

The Situation:

I’m using FlutterFlow to connect my app with an API (using API Flow). The setup is mostly done—I’ve connected the API, and it seems to be communicating fine. But here’s the issue:

The Problem:

While the API call is successfully triggered, the data isn’t showing up on the UI as expected. 🤔
I’ve confirmed the API connection and set up the data flow, but FlutterFlow’s UI doesn’t seem to fetch or display the data correctly.

What I’ve Tried:
1. Checked API connection settings: API key and URL seem fine.
2. Used dynamic data sources in FlutterFlow to bind API data to the UI.

What’s Next:

I’m thinking of bringing in a FlutterFlow expert to help me with:
1. Fixing the data-binding issue between the API response and the UI.
2. Ensuring the API call is properly mapped to the fields that need to display the data.
3. Debugging any potential CORS or data handling problems that might be causing the issue.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Any tips or suggestions? Would love to hear how you resolved similar issues!

Meadow is building AI-powered tools to help counter-serve restaurants run more efficiently. We replace traditional security cameras with smart vision systems that not only keep an eye on things but also provide real-time business insights—like spotting long lines that cause lost sales, identifying bottlenecks in the queue, tracking ingredient usage to reduce waste, detecting upsell attempts to boost revenue, and monitoring order accuracy to improve customer satisfaction. We present all of this information on a BI Dashboard that makes it easy for our customers to digest how their restaurants are operating. Our goal is to give restaurants the data they need to operate smarter, faster, and more profitably.
We are a seed-stage start-up. Our engineering team currently consists of two data engineers, two backend engineers, one AI scientist, and a few contractors. You would be the Senior Frontend Engineer on our team responsible for defining the best practices in building our customer facing applications! We already have two customers under contract, representing over 100 locations, with several more strong prospects in the pipeline. As we continue to grow, we’re focused on expanding our technology and proving its impact across different types of food service operations.


Senior Frontend Engineer
Meadow is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer who is comfortable laying the groundwork for the frontend applications that we are building for our customers. You should use best practices in software development, and standard web technologies.
You'll be working on things like creating mobile responsive web applications for our security camera platform, building BI dashboards, building modular charting and eventually customer customizable dashboards, and creating automated testing. We need someone who can collaborate with backend engineers and define what is needed to make delightful customer experiences.
We’re looking for strong proficiency in React, along with familiarity with common web technologies, and deployment tools to get our applications into production.
We’re a seed-stage company, which means our technical focus will shift as the business evolves. If you're excited about working across different AI domains, making pragmatic technical decisions, and building something that directly impacts real businesses, we’d love to hear from you.

We provide custom strategies for our users, and using TradingViews built in Strategy Backtester metrics, we want a dashboard that tracks that info straight to the dashboard interface. This dashboard would be giving real time trade performance information for every strategy, and there would be a ranking leaderboard for the most profitable strategies the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Besides the main dashboard itself, each strategy would need to be able to be clicked on to view more detailed strategy performance of each strategy. A user would then have the option to copy that strategy and automate it in a simple copy bot format.

Key requirements:

- We do not know how to integrate the backtest and live forward test performance metrics from TradingView, whether that be through API, webhooks, or web scraping - but we would want a developer that could figure that out.
- The user interface should provide a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics. A ranking leaderboard of the most profitable strategies for different time periods (7 days, 30 days, 90 days)
- Experience with TradingView and its API, Web Scraping, Webhooks.
- Proven track record in developing trading bots.
- Familiarity with the mentioned trading platforms.
- Strong programming skills, preferably in Python or JavaScript.
- Proficiency in web development with experience in creating interactive dashboards.
- A strong understanding of data visualization techniques.
- Prior experience working with TradingView or similar trading platforms is required.


PHASE 1 WOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

- Strategy Performance Dashboard with Ranking Leaderboard of Strategies based on net profit % during certain time periods.
- Detailed Performance Page for each individual strategy from the dashboard.
- Admin Panel to add/edit/or remove TradingView strategies.
- Admin Panel to add/edit/ or remove users to use the dashboard platform.
- User Favorites page where users can view the strategies they have favorited from the dashboard. (only if we don't do phase 2)

TradingView Integrations
• Connect to TradingView backtesting data through API, webhooks, web scraping or however possible. (for live data, strategy tracking) Would need the developer to find the best solution for this.

PHASE 2 WOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

Incorporating a Trading Bot (Copy Bot) into the strategy performance tracking dashboard.
Users would be able to select a strategy to automate and copy the signals from.
Would want the following exchanges broker included - Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, Robinhood, Tradovate, Tradestation, MetaTrader, Interactive Brokers.

- Creating the bot dashboard (simple, easy to use system for users)
- Connecting Exchanges/Brokers panel.
- Trade History panel
- User Live Trade Portfolio panel.

Scalability & Performance – Ensure fast and reliable data retrieval for high-volume queries.

Ideal Skills & Experience:

I’m facing an issue with Flask session persistence after the OAuth login flow with Google. When the user logs in and is redirected back to my site, a new session is created, causing the app to lose stored credentials.

Issue Details:
- The Flask app is storing Google OAuth credentials in the session (session[""google_credentials""]).
- After the OAuth login redirect (/google/callback), the session is lost and a new session file is created in the flask_session folder.
- Debugging confirms:
   - Cookies are enabled and being set in the browser.
   - Session data exists before redirect but disappears after.
session.keys() only shows [""_permanent""] after the redirect.
- I have tried setting:
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = ""None""
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   - SESSION_TYPE = ""filesystem""
- Issue persists despite these fixes.

Project Details:
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Auth Flow: Google OAuth 2.0
- Session Management: Flask-Session (filesystem-based)
- Hosting: Local development for now (planning for deployment)

Deliverables:
- Diagnose and fix the session persistence issue.
- Ensure session[""google_credentials""] is retained after the redirect.
- Provide a clear explanation of the fix so I can implement it in the future.
- Verify Google Calendar API authentication works properly.

- Strong understanding of Flask-Session and cookie behavior

- Custom branding options (fonts and layout adjustments)

Ideal Candidate

We are looking for an experienced developer to build a document scanning and editing feature within our SaaS-based fleet management platform. This feature will enable fleet managers to upload, scan, and edit work orders, invoices, and maintenance records with high accuracy and efficiency. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface where users can click on the document to highlight corresponding fields in the form, and vice versa (similar to Nanonets).
The front-end should align with the UX/UI standards of modern SaaS applications, ensuring a seamless, structured workflow for processing scanned work orders. The system should handle large document sets efficiently, validate extracted data, and provide a guided review process for error correction.

https://app.nanonets.com/ is a great example app that does this well. Here is a video showing it:
https://www.loom.com/share/f5aa28ec26e54da49e9ea191f4b1b904

Technical Scope
Document Upload & Processing
File Upload UI:
Drag-and-drop and direct file selection.
Show a real-time progress bar during upload.
Validate file formats and display a preview before submission.
OCR & Data Extraction:
Extract key fields from work orders, invoices, and maintenance logs (e.g., date, vendor, part details, labor costs, total amounts).
Implement error handling and detailed feedback for missing or incorrectly parsed fields.

Interactive Editing & Validation
Two-way document interaction:
Clicking a field in the document highlights the corresponding field in the form, and vice versa.
Allow inline editing of all extracted values.
Editable fields include cost, quantity, unit price, markup, and descriptions.
Bounding Box Coordination:
Each extracted field is visually outlined in the document with a bounding box.
When a user selects a field in the form, the corresponding bounding box in the document is highlighted for better visibility.
Users can drag and resize bounding boxes to correct OCR misalignment if needed.
Implement real-time field linking where adjustments in the bounding box automatically update the extracted value in the form.
Ensure bounding boxes adapt dynamically for multi-page documents and various font styles.
Guided Validation & Review:
Introduce a step-by-step verification process with collapsible sections for labor, parts, and total costs.
Users must check off each section before submitting.
Error-checking bubbles should provide inline hints for verification.
Zoom & Navigation Improvements:
A hand tool should allow smooth movement inside the zoomed document (instead of using scroll bars).
Ensure smooth scrolling behavior where the left panel (document preview) remains fixed, while the right panel (form) scrolls independently.

Expected Deliverables
✅ Fully functional document scanning & editing tool integrated into the fleet management platform.
✅ User-friendly UI/UX for uploading, validating, and editing scanned work orders.
✅ Real-time interactive editing between scanned documents and form fields.
✅ Optimized OCR pipeline that minimizes scan time while maintaining accuracy.
✅ Guided walkthrough validation process with collapsible sections and inline hints.



Skills Required
🟢 Frontend: React.js, Ant Design (preferred), modern UI frameworks.
🟢 Backend: Node.js, Python (for OCR/AI processing), SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
🟢 File Processing: PDF/image parsing, error handling, validation

Project Milestones & Timeline
📌 Developer to provide a quote and estimated timeline for completion.
📌 Proposal should outline:
Relevant experience in document processing apps.
Past projects with document parsing and interactive UI design.
Estimated timeline & budget for completion.

Next Steps
Interested developers should submit a proposal with:
Previous experience with OCR, document parsing, and interactive form design.
Approach for improving scanning speed & UI usability.
Proposed budget & development timeline.

We  are seeking an experienced Cloud Database Developer to build and integrate a scalable cloud database that synchronizes NetSuite, vendor data, and our company website. The ideal candidate will have expertise in cloud database architecture, API development, and NetSuite integration to ensure seamless automation and data flow.

Additionally, We are open to evaluating pre-built cloud-based platforms that can fulfill the same needs with existing tools. The developer will be responsible for assessing whether an off-the-shelf solution (such as Unleashed Software, Coupa, or DCKAP) could be integrated efficiently, or if a fully custom solution is required.

Scope of Work

1. Cloud Database Development (Custom Build Option)

Design and implement a cloud-based database (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or similar).

Structure data to store vendor parts, inventory data, and drop-ship availability.

Implement data validation and cleaning rules to ensure consistency across vendors.

2. Pre-Built Cloud Platform Evaluation (Alternative Approach)

Research and recommend existing SaaS platforms that handle vendor management, NetSuite integration, and website data syncing.

Assess feasibility and cost comparison between a custom-built cloud database vs. a pre-built SaaS solution.

If a SaaS platform is selected, handle custom integration and API development to fit AMS Parts’ requirements.

3. NetSuite Integration

Develop API connections to sync vendor parts data into NetSuite while protecting inventory records.

Enable two-way sync where NetSuite updates (new parts, inventory levels) reflect in the cloud database or pre-built solution.

Automate import processes for vendor-provided part lists (CSV, Excel, or API feeds).

4. Website Synchronization

Build an API that allows the website to pull live data from the cloud database or SaaS solution.

Ensure website updates include part availability, descriptions, and compatibility information in real-time.

Optimize performance for fast queries and reliable uptime. Eventually we would like to move into ecommerce platform such as Suite commerce or Big Commerce.

5. Error Handling & Reporting

Implement automated checks for duplicate records, missing part descriptions, and pricing mismatches.

Develop an admin dashboard for our team members to review and correct flagged errors before syncing data.

Ideal Candidate Skills & Experience

Cloud Database Management: Experience with AWS RDS, Google Cloud, Firebase, or similar.

API Development & Integration: Proficiency in RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and webhooks.

NetSuite Customization: Knowledge of SuiteScript 2.0, SuiteTalk API, or similar for seamless integration.

Data Processing & ETL: Experience in handling large-scale data imports and transformations.

E-commerce & Website Data Sync: Familiarity with website backend development and performance optimization.

SaaS Evaluation & Integration: Experience working with pre-built ERP, inventory, or supply chain management platforms.

Project Details

Contract Type: Fixed-price or hourly (please provide estimates in your proposal). As well as possible time frame to build.

Budget: Open to quotes based on expertise and project scope.

Start Date: ASAP.

How to Apply

Interested candidates should submit a proposal including:

Relevant experience with cloud databases, SaaS solutions, and NetSuite integrations.

Examples of past projects where they built similar API-driven data sync solutions or integrated pre-built platforms.

Technical approach to handling vendor data, inventory sync, and website updates.

Estimated timeline & budget quote.

We are looking for a highly skilled developer to create an efficient, scalable, and automated data synchronization system.

### **Freelancer Needed: Website Performance Optimization (WordPress + Divi + Hostinger + Cloudflare)**  

We are looking for an experienced web developer to optimize our WordPress website built with **Divi** and hosted on **Hostinger**. We use **Cloudflare CDN** (which has been purged) and the **LiteSpeed Cache plugin**, but we need to fix **the root cause** of our **page and image loading issues**, not just rely on caching plugins.  

#### **Project Overview**  
Our website has **page speed issues** affecting user experience and SEO. Our **Pingdom, GTmetrix, and PageSpeed Insights** reports highlight issues related to **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, which we need to fix.  

**Key Metrics (PageSpeed Insights on Mobile, Slow 4G, Moto G Power Emulation):**  
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 3.0s  
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 5.2s  
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** 120ms  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.509  
- **Speed Index:** 4.0s  

### **What Needs to Be Fixed?**  
We need a developer who can **directly optimize our site** by working on:  

#### **1. Image Optimization (Prevent LCP & CLS Issues)**  
- Ensure **all images have explicit width and height attributes** to prevent layout shifts.  
- Fix **""media element lacking an explicit size""** errors.  
- Implement **lazy loading properly** while maintaining image dimensions.  
- Use **CSS object-fit: cover/contain** to prevent distortion.  

#### **2. Reduce Unused JavaScript & CSS**  
- Identify and remove **unused JavaScript (potential savings: 146 KB)**.  
- Reduce **unused CSS (potential savings: 18 KB)**.  
- Avoid **serving legacy JavaScript** to modern browsers (9 KB savings).  
- Optimize **JavaScript execution and defer unnecessary scripts** to improve FCP/LCP.

It does everything I need it to do like captions / subtitles, etc.

I now want to add a feature that ingests a long video (assume 1 hour) and identifies the viral %10% best clips and cuts them into short vids for Tiktok, Reels, YT Shorts, etc.

Therefore, the logic must be SMART enough to figure out which parts of the long video are worth cutting.

** IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO WORK WITH. **

We obviously use:
- NodeJS / Next JS
- FFmpeg
- Remotion
- OpenAI or other AI LLM to do the identification and cutting.

** IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO WORK WITH. **

REQUIREMENTS:
----
1) DELIVERABLE - You present me with working flow. You get paid and a great review.

2) SOLUTION & COST PER VIDEO PROCESSED (cost per video rendering) - the solution must be cheap to create a video -- obviously if it costs $5 to cut a single video, it's NOT marketable. I'm looking for a solution that can get such videos renderered in cents.

3) SMART SELECTION OF CLIPS & CUTTING - the clips chosen by the AI must make sense and be the best clips of the video. Obviously. we can't be perfect all the time but you shouldn't have basic issues like cutting off the voice mid-sentence, choosing completely irrelevant clips, etc.

4) TECH STACK - Must use our tech stack as this feature will be bolted on to an existing app that is built on NodeJS (back-end), NextJS (frontend), MongoDB (database), and Redis for caching. We already use FFmpeg which you will need.

5) TIMELINE - Want this done within 2 weeks or less.

6) COMMENTED CODE - well structured, clean, commented code so that my dev can easily bolt it on to my app.

We're facing a situation that requires your expertise and a significant code overhaul. Here's what you need to know:

Current setup: We have a WordPress website with booking functionality built using Guesty's Open API. The code is currently located in the WordPress theme editor.

Existing features: The site displays a search box, listings, and booking options.

Problem: We've realized that we need to add filters to our listings and change from a base price to a calendar-based pricing system. Unfortunately, the Open API isn't ideal for these requirements.

Solution: We need to transition from Guesty's Open API to their Booking Engine API (BE-API).

Your task: You'll need to convert our existing code to work with the BE-API. This involves:

Setting up a new BE-API instance

Rewriting our API calls to use BE-API endpoints

Implementing new filtering functionality

Updating the pricing display to show calendar-based prices

Challenges: This transition will require significant changes to the existing codebase. You'll need to familiarize yourself with both the current implementation and the BE-API documentation.

I’ve built an Android app but I am not an android developer by trade, back-end end Java developer. The application works, but I know there’s plenty of room to write better, cleaner, and more efficient code—and that’s where you come in.
What I Need:

I’m looking for a developer with strong Android/Kotlin expertise to do a deep dive into my code and give actionable feedback on:

    Code Structure & Architecture – Is it well-organized? Any refactoring needed?
    Best Practices – Am I following MVVM, Jetpack Compose, and other modern patterns correctly?
    Performance Optimization – Any inefficiencies that could slow things down?
    Error Handling & Stability – Any weak points that might cause crashes or bad user experiences?
    Scalability & Maintainability – Would this codebase be easy to expand and maintain long-term?

I don’t need vague feedback—I need specific recommendations. If something can be done in a better way, tell me how. If there are anti-patterns, unnecessary complexity, or missing optimizations, call them out.
Who I’m Looking For:

    Strong Kotlin & Android experience (Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Coroutines, etc.)
    Someone who’s worked on real-world production apps and knows what scales well
    Comfortable reviewing someone else’s code and explaining how to improve it

I’ll provide access to the repo, and ideally, I’d like a written report or a video walkthrough with your suggestions.

We would request the job be split into 2 milestone payments - the first for helping us pull data from each source. The second milestone will be for creating a template for each API - this can just be a simple google doc or even a .txt file.

The main goal is to help users (primarily students) create and study flashcards, summaries, and quizzes, with the option to generate them automatically from uploaded PDFs, images, or text.

Below is an overview of the functionality I’d like implemented:
1. User Registration and Profiles
Sign Up / Log In: Standard email/password or social logins.
Profile Settings: Basic information, notification preferences, and language settings.

2. Flashcard Creation & Management
Manual Creation: Users can manually add flashcards (front/back or question/answer) with formatting (bold, italics, etc.).
Automated Generation: Users can upload a file or paste text, and the app should parse it to identify key concepts. Automatically create flashcards from that content (similar to mindgrasp.ai or Vaia).

3. Flashcard Library
Organized Sets: Users can group flashcards into themed sets or subjects (like Quizlet).
Search & Filter: By title, subject, difficulty, or date created.
Share Options (optional, if time permits): Let users share sets with friends or make them public.

4. Study & Quiz Features
Flip-Based Study: Show front side first, then reveal the answer on the back (like traditional flashcards).
Difficulty/Confidence Rating: After viewing an answer, user labels how easy or hard it was. This data can feed a spaced repetition algorithm so that harder cards appear more frequently.
Progress Tracking: Display how many cards are left, correct/incorrect counts, or a progress bar.
Multiple Question Types (optional): If possible, beyond just “flip cards,” we might introduce multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

5. AI/Spaced Repetition Integration
Adaptive Scheduling: Cards rated “hard” appear more often than easier ones (similar to Anki).
Summaries & Key Concepts: If possible, incorporate an AI summarizer that condenses large pieces of text into bullet points or potential Q&A pairs.

6. User Experience & Interface
Clean, Intuitive UI: Reference Quizlet’s minimal approach.
Visual Cues: Simple icons for flipping cards, rating difficulty, or uploading documents (similar to Vaia’s design style).
Responsive Design: Should work smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.


7. Additional Features (Nice to Have)
Achievements/Analytics: Show stats like how many cards studied, average success rate, or daily streaks to motivate learning.

It will provide tools for uploading cruise sheets (forestry measurement data), calculating various timber volume metrics (calculations provided), and visualizing forest composition with basic graphs.

-Core Capabilities-

Property and Stand Management

Create and manage multiple forest properties
Organize forests into logical ""stands"" (management units)
Track data by geographic region to apply appropriate regional conversion factors
Delete properties and stands when no longer needed


Data Import and Processing

Upload Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) timber cruise sheets
Process raw data into standardized metrics
Store data in a structured database for analysis


Volume Calculations

Calculate key forestry metrics from basal area measurements:

Basal area per acre (ft²)
Stems per acre
Cords per acre
Cubic feet per acre
Tons per acre
MBF (thousand board feet) per acre




Region-Specific Calculations

Apply different conversion factors (provided) for various US regions:

Northeast
Southeast
Midwest
West
Pacific Northwest


Account for regional differences in tree growth patterns and measurement standards


Species-Specific Factors

Apply species-specific modifiers (provided) to account for differences in:

Wood density
Tree form
Growth patterns

Support for numerous tree species including:

Softwoods (Red Spruce, White Pine, Balsam Fir, etc.)
Hardwoods (Oak, Maple, Birch, etc.)


Visualization Tools

Generate charts and graphs including:

Species composition pie charts
Volume distribution bar charts


Display summary statistics in tabular format
Compare data across stands and properties


Data Export

Export data to PDF for reports and documentation
Print capability as a fallback for PDF generation


User Access Control

User-specific data management (each user can only see their own properties)


Administration Features

Shortcode integration ([forest_inventory]) for embedding the tool on any page


Technical Implementation
The plugin follows WordPress plugin architecture best practices:

Separate admin and public-facing components
Database tables for properties, stands, and inventory data
AJAX-based data processing for a responsive user experience
Integration with Chart.js for data visualization
Dependency management for required libraries (PhpSpreadsheet for Excel processing)
Internationalization support

Data Processing Methodology
The plugin employs a sophisticated two-factor approach to calculate timber volumes:

Regional base factors specific to different parts of the country
Species-specific modifiers that account for differences in wood properties

This approach provides more accurate volume estimates than a one-size-fits-all calculation method and allows for professional-grade timber inventory management directly within WordPress.
User Interface
The interface is divided into four main tabs:

Properties - View and manage existing properties and stands
Create Property - Add new forest properties to the system
Add Stand - Upload cruise data for a specific stand within a property
Data View - Visualize and analyze inventory data with charts and tables

Overall, this plugin will provide comprehensive forest inventory management capabilities for woodland owners, foresters, and timber management professionals in a user-friendly WordPress interface.

Hello,
We have developed a Quiz Elite-like Q&A application that helps students practice and learn by answering subject-related questions. Users can create rooms, compete with each other, and collaborate.

However, due to an unfortunate accident involving our previous developer, the project was left incomplete. We are now looking for a talented developer to finish the remaining features.

Pending Features:
✅ Single-Player Mode: A system that allows users to play individually.
✅ Live Chat System:

Students should be able to join admin-created rooms and chat live.
The admin panel should allow unlimited room creation, with the ability to open and close rooms at specific times.
Moderation Controls:
Admin should be able to ban disruptive users and assign moderators.
Users should have the ability to block, report, or mute messages from inappropriate or disruptive individuals.
💡 Alternative Solution: The chat system does not necessarily have to be integrated within the app. We have our own server, so we can redirect users to a web-based chat system. A subdomain-based separate system is also an option. I trust your professional approach—my priority is a reliable, fast, and seamless solution.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Java Spring Boot, JpaRepository, Spring Security, JWT Security
Frontend: Vue.js
Database: PostgreSQL
💡 You can either develop on top of the existing code or integrate a ready-made solution (e.g., Codecanyon, etc.).

This is not just another trading app—it’s a complete trader’s command center with powerful features that make it easier to track wallets, analyze market movements, and execute trades with zero delay.

Key Features & Functionality:
✅ Full-Screen Trading Interface – The entire screen should be dedicated to trading, with real-time price charts, live orders, and instant execution. No distractions.
✅ Wallet Tracker – Tracks real-time holdings, PNL (profit & loss), and transaction history for any connected Solana wallet. Users can see all their assets in one place, with AI-generated insights.
✅ Live Buy & Sell Feed – Real-time order flow tracking to show exactly who’s buying, who’s selling, and how much Solana is moving at any given second.
✅ Trading Volume Monitor – Tracks the 24-hour volume, liquidity, and market depth for different meme coins and tokens on Pump.fun, MoonShot, and Solana DEXs.
✅ Meme Coin Sniper – AI-powered tool that tracks trending meme coins before they pump. This feature scans Pump.fun, MoonShot, GitHub activity, Discord mentions, and whale buys to spot the next big moonshot.
✅ Instant Swap & Trade Execution – Users should be able to buy and sell directly within the platform, integrating Solana’s top DEXs for the best rates and lowest slippage.
✅ Transaction Breakdown & Analytics – Every buy, sell, and swap should be categorized and visualized so users know exactly how they’re trading and what’s making (or losing) them money.
✅ Sniper Bot Integration – Users should have an AI-assisted sniper tool to place limit orders before launch, ensuring they get in early on hyped tokens.
✅ AI Trade Copilot – The AI should analyze historical trades, predict market trends, and provide users with smart buy/sell suggestions based on volume, liquidity, and sentiment data.
✅ Leaderboard & Community Stats – A “Top Traders” board showing the best-performing wallets, their trades, and strategies (anonymized for privacy).

Design Notes:
Reference: Take inspiration from BullX Neo, but don’t copy it. We’re focusing on functionality first.
Ultra-Fast UI – The interface needs to be smooth, zero lag, and fully optimized for desktop & mobile trading.
No Clutter – Everything should be clear, intuitive, and designed for efficiency. Traders don’t want to waste time clicking through menus.
Next Steps:
Get the wallet tracker + live trade data + volume tracker working first.
Integrate DEX swaps & sniper bot functionalities.
Optimize the AI trading assistant to analyze trading patterns, sentiment, and volume surges.

However, due to Lovable.dev’s limitations on collaboration, I’d like to work closely with someone throughout the process rather than just handing over the project.

This means I’m looking for someone who can not only help implement solutions but also guide me along the way, explaining what’s happening and how I can make better technical decisions in the future. I don’t want a “done-for-you” approach—I want to understand the changes being made and what I could do differently next time.

Project Overview:

I’ve built an app that enables quick, on-the-fly proposal creation during sales calls. These proposals can be updated post-call, shared via live links, and compared side-by-side. However, I need help solving a few major challenges:

Key Challenges to Solve:
1. Optimize Shared Results Load Time
• The “Shared Results” page, which displays past proposals, takes too long to load (sometimes over 1.5 minutes).
• It includes details such as proposal creator, assignee, attendees, creation date, status (draft/published), and actions (edit, delete, copy, view).
• I need improvements in query efficiency and performance to make this load faster.
2. Fix OpenAI Integration for Proposal Summaries
• The proposal editor includes a “Generate Summary” feature that should extract key details from a transcript via OpenAI.
• The summary sections include:
• Introduction
• Solution Overview
• Current Situation
• Future Goals
• Challenges
• Currently, generating summaries fails with the error: “Analysis error. Failed to send a request to the edge function.”
• I need help diagnosing whether this is an issue with my Supabase edge function or the OpenAI API request.
3. Potential Expansion: AI Demo System
• I have a table containing URLs for live AI demos that simulate real-world AI chat experiences.
• I want to create a searchable demo experience where users can select an industry and test AI interactions relevant to their needs.
• I’m unsure whether this should be a separate project or an extension of my current system. I’d love input on the best approach.

Ideal Skills & Experience:
• Supabase: Experience optimizing queries and edge functions.
• OpenAI API: Familiarity with integrating AI-driven text generation.
• Full-Stack Development: Strong background in backend optimization and UI performance.
• Database Performance Optimization: Ability to debug slow-loading pages and speed up data retrieval.
• Mentorship & Collaboration: Willingness to walk me through the process, answer questions, and explain decisions.
• Experience with AI Demos (Optional): If you have experience building interactive AI showcases, that’s a bonus.

Next Steps:

If this sounds like a project you can help with, please include:
• A brief explanation of how you would approach fixing the slow-loading shared results page.
• Your experience with Supabase edge functions and OpenAI API integrations.
• Any thoughts on whether the AI demo system should be a separate project or an extension of the current app.
• Your experience with mentoring or coaching developers through technical challenges.

Project Overview

We are looking for a skilled developer or team to build a custom bingo app that eliminates the need for paper bingo cards at live events. This is not traditional bingo—we use music-based categories instead of numbers (e.g., artist names, genres, styles).
The app must allow players to join live games via a code, tap squares based on the host's callouts, and claim Bingo in real-time. The first correct Bingo wins (no ties), and players who falsely claim Bingo twice are eliminated.
Key Features

✅ Custom Bingo Board Generator (Admin sets categories)
✅ Live Game Mode (In-person & remote play)
✅ Scalable for 2,500 players per game
✅ Admin Dashboard (Create/manage games, verify winners)
✅ Monetization (Charge per game, sell extra boards)
✅ Prize Payout System (PayPal, CashApp, or custom gateway)
✅ Push Notifications & Chat
