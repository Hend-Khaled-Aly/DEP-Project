android_developer,Create simple Web App for taxi business for customers to book trips online using escrow payment,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-simple-Web-App-for-taxi-business-for-customers-book-trips-online-using-escrow-payment_~021898377891861965802/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,1,Australia,"Web App Development: Online Taxi Booking System  

Overview
We need a simple yet efficient Web App for a small taxi business, allowing passengers to book trips online seamlessly. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for customers to enter trip details, calculate fares, make payments, and enable admins to manage bookings efficiently.



Core Features & Functionality

1. Customer Booking Form  
Customers should be able to enter the following details:  
- Customer Name  
- Customer mobile number
- Pick-up Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Drop-off Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Number of Passengers
- Add Stop/Multiple Destinations Option (if required)  
- Date & Time Selection:
  - Book Now (immediate trip request)  
  - Schedule for Later (calendar-based date & time selection)  

2. Fare Calculation & Payment Processing  
- The system will calculate the trip fare based on a formula that we will provide later.  
- Customers proceed with payment, which will be held in escrow (or any better alternative recommended by the developer).  

3. Booking Approval Process (Admin Panel)  
- Admin receives a notification for each booking request.  
- Admin can Accept or Reject the booking.  
- If Rejected: Payment is automatically refunded, and the customer is notified with the reason (e.g., ""No driver available"").  
- If Accepted:  
  - Admin is prompted to assign the ride to a driver from a predefined driver list.  
  - Customer receives booking confirmation text with driver details  

4. Ride Completion & Cancellation Handling
- Once a ride is accepted, admin is prompted with:  
  - End Ride (indicating the trip was successfully completed).  
  - Ride Cancelled (if a cancellation occurs).  
- If the ride is cancelled after being accepted, the payment is refunded back to the customer automatically.  

5. Driver Management (Admin Panel)  
- Ability to maintain a list of drivers in the system.  
- Assign drivers to accepted rides.  
- Show assigned driver details to customers upon booking confirmation.  



Technical Considerations
- Google Maps API for location inputs and fare estimation.  
- Escrow-based payment solution (or developer‚Äôs recommendation for an alternative secure transaction system).  
- Admin Panel for managing bookings and drivers.  
- Responsive UI (desktop & mobile-friendly). We can provide this if needed.
- Scalability for future mobile app development (Android & iOS).  

We look forward to a long-term collaboration for future improvements and eventually mobile app development.  Looking forward to working with the right developer to help grow our small passenger transport business! üôè",3,"['Web Application', 'C#', 'JavaScript', 'PHP', 'Python', 'Square', 'Web Development', 'Haskell', 'Java', 'Payment Gateway Integration']",2,2.0,0.0,0.0,1400.0,0,43.0,19.0,50.0,1,0,0,1399.9999999999998

Hello,
We have developed a Quiz Elite-like Q&A application that helps students practice and learn by answering subject-related questions. Users can create rooms, compete with each other, and collaborate.

However, due to an unfortunate accident involving our previous developer, the project was left incomplete. We are now looking for a talented developer to finish the remaining features.

Pending Features:
‚úÖ Single-Player Mode: A system that allows users to play individually.
‚úÖ Live Chat System:

Students should be able to join admin-created rooms and chat live.
The admin panel should allow unlimited room creation, with the ability to open and close rooms at specific times.
Moderation Controls:
Admin should be able to ban disruptive users and assign moderators.
Users should have the ability to block, report, or mute messages from inappropriate or disruptive individuals.
üí° Alternative Solution: The chat system does not necessarily have to be integrated within the app. We have our own server, so we can redirect users to a web-based chat system. A subdomain-based separate system is also an option. I trust your professional approach‚Äîmy priority is a reliable, fast, and seamless solution.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Java Spring Boot, JpaRepository, Spring Security, JWT Security
Frontend: Vue.js
Database: PostgreSQL
üí° You can either develop on top of the existing code or integrate a ready-made solution (e.g., Codecanyon, etc.).

Our workers use a custom-built app to log their timesheets daily, and these records form the basis for payroll processing and client invoicing. However, our current system is inefficient because the backend database is on a separate platform from Google Sheets. As a result, our bookkeeper must manually copy and paste data between systems, slowing down operations.

Our goal is to integrate Google Sheets as the backend database to automate processes, streamline payroll, and eventually integrate AI-driven features for further efficiency.

Project Overview

We need an experienced developer to update our existing app while keeping the current functionality intact. The focus is on integrating Google Sheets as the backend database. We want to ensure that:

All worker, client, and timesheet data is stored and managed via Google Sheets.

The app frontend allows workers to sign up, log timesheets, and view payroll details.

Google Sheets remains fully synchronized with the app, allowing two-way data updates.

Our bookkeeper can manually update the Google Sheets database, and changes should be reflected in the app in real time.

If updating the existing app proves too difficult, we are open to developing a new version based on the current functionality, but with an improved and optimized backend using Google Sheets.

Scope of Work

Phase 1: Google Sheets Integration & App Update

Migrate the current app backend to Google Sheets.

Maintain current functionality while improving performance and stability.

Ensure that all app data (workers, clients, timesheets) is stored in structured Google Sheets tables.

Implement two-way synchronization between Google Sheets and the app.

Maintain existing timesheet calculations (overtime, night shifts, etc.) without rebuilding formulas.

Ensure payroll calculations and invoicing processes remain intact but operate directly from Google Sheets.

Optimize existing automation to reduce manual copy-pasting by our bookkeeper.

Phase 2: Future Developments (Optional, Long-Term Collaboration)

Email Automation: Implement MailerLite API integration for automated email sequences.

Contract Automation: Use SignNow API to automate contract submissions.

AI Agent Deployment: Develop AI agents to analyze worker data and assist in decision-making.

Chatbot Integration: Integrate with Chatbase or another chatbot that can read data in real time and provide workers with relevant information.

Further System Enhancements: Additional automation features to streamline labor hire operations.

Requirements

Proven experience in app development and backend integration.

Strong knowledge of Google Sheets API and real-time data synchronization.

Experience using AI tools for coding efficiency.

Ability to optimize processes while maintaining quality.

Experience with API integrations (MailerLite, SignNow, Chatbase, etc.).

Ability to work with our current designs or adapt to a Figma template.

How to Apply

If you‚Äôre interested in this project, please provide:

Examples of previous work relevant to app development and database integration.

Confirmation that you have the required skills.

Confirmation that you will use AI tools to optimize development speed and cost-effectiveness.

Optional: Your thoughts on future developments and long-term collaboration.

- The project involves creating an application for a company that provides software to local auctioneers and auction houses.
- The application's primary use case is inventory ingestion for heavy equipment brought to auction yards.
- The app aims to bridge the connection between inventory ingestion and catalog availability for online bidding.
- The company lacks expertise in React and React Native, despite having broad software experience.

Technical Challenges and Requirements
- The application must be offline-first due to poor connectivity in remote auction yards and warehouse locations.
- Data synchronization with the cloud is crucial and must be resilient to connection interruptions.
- The app uses Realm as a NoSQL database for local storage.
- Initial hydration of the application involves SSO-based or SAML 2 compliant authentication.
- Delta synchronization strategies are employed for new inventory and changes to existing inventory.
- The API is idempotent, allowing repeated application of changes without harming server-side data structures.
- Memory requirements on Android devices are more stringent due to the variety in device quality.

Current Implementation and Issues
- The application assumes entities are Realm entities, with persistence directly queried in some locations.
- Realm is used for both key-value and deeper level storage, including authentication, user data, and SAML 2 tokens.
- During beta testing, only 7 out of 67 pictures taken of one piece of equipment were successfully uploaded to storage.
- The developer suspects issues with object listening or state invalidation that require expertise in React Native to resolve.

Proposed Solutions and Development Approach
- The new developer suggests implementing a sync queue to store pending changes of Realm objects.
- Each entry in the sync queue will track its status (pending, in progress, failed).
- The sync logic will process the queue when the network is available, marking items as successful or retrying with a backoff strategy.
- Realm transactions will ensure data integrity during synchronization.
- Component lifecycles will be tied to Realm objects via subscriptions to prevent React Native errors when objects are deleted.

Work Style and Communication
- The developer typically works on an EST schedule, available from 9 AM to 5 or 6 PM.
- Daily updates and progress videos will be provided.
- The project uses an Expo system for receiving changes and providing new builds.
- Commits should be small and targeted, avoiding large refactors with numerous changes.
- Code reviews will be conducted throughout the day.
- The developer will work primarily on weekdays, aiming for a 30-hour work week.

The app needs to prompt users to capture all required information, one photo at a time.

For example, the amount of ducts/pipes at each end of the pit/manhole.

On top of capturing this information in the photo, there will be check boxes to identify specific information.

On top of this, I would like the app to generate a sheet that documents and draws up that information, providing an overall pit/manhole layout.

I have sample sheets to show how these final sheets should look, and ideas on how we could capture this information accurately and easily.

The photos would need to save directly onto the phone being used, on the app, and potentially directly  onto a selected folder.

If you see the attached, you will see the required information and the samples of the Manhole Sheets.

I have ideas on how I would see this being a useful tool, but I'm open to suggestions.

Is it possible to take a photo of the end of a pit or manhole, then have options to select certain ducts on the pit wall, and flag them as a certain size, and also what remaining capacity they have?

If you look at the photo attached, you will see the side of a manhole with multiple ducts. These vary in size and remaining capacity.  

I imagine being able to click a duct on the photo, then click a check box that specifies a size and another that specifies a remaining capacity (what can still fit in the duct, with what's already there)

By doing this, the collected info can be generated onto a Manhole Sheet as per the attached example?

You would also need to be available for any further updates or issues into the future, and quite likely other similar projects.",2,"['Smartphone', 'Web Development', 'CSS', 'iPadOS', 'Android', 'Mobile App Design', 'iOS', 'Web Design', 'JavaScript', 'Prototyping']",1,2.0,0.0,0.0,2300.0,0,8.0,0.0,500.0,1,0,0,2300.000000000001

The platform should allow users to complete geolocated challenges, earn points and badges, and see their ranking on a global leaderboard.
I understand that a web app is more cost-effective than a native mobile app (Android/iOS), but if possible, I would love to receive a quotation for both. My priority is to start with the web app, and if it gains traction, I would like to complement it with a mobile app.
üîπ Main Requirements:
‚úÖ User Registration/Login: Email, Google, Facebook, TikTok.
‚úÖ User Profile: Photo, name, counter of completed challenges, points, earned badges, and a summary of transportation methods used (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Challenge System: A predefined list of challenges created by me or premium users, categorized by type and location.
‚úÖ Statistics Section: Similar to Polarsteps, users should be able to see personalized travel stats, including:
‚Ä¢ Number of challenges completed
‚Ä¢ % of each open challenge completed
‚Ä¢ Total locations visited
‚Ä¢ Distance traveled
‚Ä¢ Number of different transportation methods used
‚Ä¢ Most visited countries/cities
‚Ä¢ Etc.
‚úÖ Bulk Challenge Upload: I already have 1,000 challenge locations in Mexico, and the system must allow easy mass uploads, as the number of locations will continue to grow with each new country and challenge category I add. This should be considered in terms of database scalability and performance.
‚úÖ Challenge Proof Submission: Users must upload at least one photo per challenge location.
‚úÖ Automatic Approval: Challenges should be auto-approved, but with an option for manual moderation if necessary.
‚úÖ Points and Badges: Each destination will grant points, and upon reaching specific milestones, users will earn collectible badges.
‚úÖ Open Check-in: Users should be able to check in at any location on the map, but badges can only be earned by completing the predefined challenges.
‚úÖ Ranking and Gamification: A global and city-based leaderboard based on earned points.
‚úÖ Geolocated Challenges: Users must physically visit designated locations to complete challenges.
‚úÖ Challenges Without a Specific Location: I need the ability to add challenges that don‚Äôt require a fixed location, such as:
‚Ä¢ Trying a specific dish
‚Ä¢ Skydiving
‚Ä¢ Rafting
‚Ä¢ Hiking or trekking
‚úÖ Transport Mode Selection: Users should specify how they arrived at the location (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Monetization:
‚Ä¢ Phase 1: Integration with AdSense and premium subscriptions.
‚Ä¢ Phase 2: Expansion to sponsorships, collaborations, and merchandise.
‚úÖ Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop, with an adventurous style similar to Polarsteps.
‚úÖ Multilanguage Support: The platform should support multiple languages from the start.
‚úÖ Easy Management: I need to be able to add new challenges, moderate content, and manage basic daily operations.
‚úÖ Training: I will need assistance learning how to manage the platform after launch.
‚úÖ International Expansion: I already have example challenges in Mexico, but I am preparing challenges for other countries.
üîπ Example Challenge Categories (Mexico):
These will serve as a model for expanding challenges to other countries:
1. Pueblos M√°gicos ‚Äì Culturally and historically significant towns.
2. Pre-Hispanic Mexico ‚Äì Archaeological sites and pre-Hispanic heritage zones.
3. Mexico‚Äôs Beaches & Coasts ‚Äì Popular coastal destinations.
4. Blue Mexico ‚Äì Lagoons, rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.
5. Green Mexico ‚Äì Natural reserves, mountains, forests, and ecological parks.
6. Mexico‚Äôs Capital Cities ‚Äì Major state capitals.
7. Famous Roads ‚Äì Iconic travel routes, especially for motorcyclists.
8. Mexican Landmarks ‚Äì Monuments and emblematic sites across cities.
9. Gastronomy ‚Äì Destinations famous for their traditional food.
10. Scenic Routes ‚Äì Roads with breathtaking views ideal for road trips.

üîπ Quotation Request:
I would like to know:
‚Ä¢ Your development proposal (recommended technologies and approach).
‚Ä¢ Estimated delivery time for the project.
‚Ä¢ Total cost based on the described functionalities.
‚Ä¢ Your post-launch support options (if available).
‚Ä¢ Payment terms: How would payments be structured (upfront, milestone-based, upon completion, etc.)?
‚Ä¢ Quotation for a mobile app (Android/iOS) in case I decide to complement the web app in the future.
Please send me a detailed quotation along with any recommendations you might have.

The MJPEG frame does not contain the correct SOI (Start of Image) ‚Äî the first two bytes, which should be 0xFF and 0xD8 respectively. In our case, SOI: 00 means that the first byte points to an incorrect SO

Sometimes a frame can be corrupted due to unstable communication or other factors that can corrupt its structure. It will be necessary to buffer several frames and only then pass them for decoding. This can help to assemble the frame from several parts.

Version 1.0 is already halfway done‚Äîwe need faster progress without sacrificing quality.
Version 2.0 development will start soon, and we want a structured, high-quality approach.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Long-Term Opportunities

Beyond this project, we have ambitious plans for future updates (Version 3.0+), an Android version, and additional advanced scouting and analytics features.

The core objective of this app is to create a fun and addictive experience while incorporating a monetization strategy through ads. The game should feature an unlimited road loop and increase in speed to keep players engaged, with obstacles that slow down the car.

Game Requirements:
Core Gameplay: A car racing game where the player drives a car on an infinite road loop.
Speed Mechanics: The speed of the car should gradually increase from 1 to 2 km, adding to the challenge as the game progresses.
Bumper Obstacles: There will be bumpers or obstacles that reduce the speed of the car when hit.
Endless Loop: The game continues indefinitely, offering endless playtime and keeping players engaged.
Simple UI: Clean, colorful, and child-friendly design with basic controls that are easy for kids to understand.
Target Audience: The game should be designed for kids aged 9-10 years old with age-appropriate graphics and difficulty level.
Monetization through Ads: The primary motive for creating this game is to run ads, so the app should support ad integrations (e.g., interstitial ads or banners) for monetization.

Milestones & Payment:
The development process will be divided into two milestones with the following payment structure:

+First Milestone (20%): At the end of the first phase, which includes the initial version of the game (basic mechanics, game flow, and initial ad integration).
+Second Milestone (80%): Upon the final delivery of the game (full app functionality, tested, and ready for deployment on app stores).

Timeline:
Project Duration: The app should be completed and fully functional within 3 months.

Additional Notes:
Testing: You will be responsible for thoroughly testing the game and fixing any bugs.
Budget: The budget is tight, so efficiency and cost-effectiveness are crucial.
Communication: Regular updates on progress are expected throughout the development process.
Ad Integration: The app's monetization through ads is a key priority, so ads should be integrated seamlessly.

Project Responsibilities:
- Develop an Android application using the DJI Mobile SDK v5.
- Implement functionality to control a DJI drone via a bi-directional gRPC channel.
- Relay take-off, landing, return-to-home (RTH) and virtual stick commands from a remote server to the drone.
- Forward the realtime video feed and telemetry data from the drone through gRPC to the server.
- Integrate gRPC and Protobuf definitions provided for the communication protocol.
- Each command is valid for 100ms. A new command received should replace the current command immediately. After a command is expired the sticks are expected to return to the neutral position to make the drone hover.
- The application UI is minimal
    - A text field to enter the remote gRPC server URL. This should be persisted across app restarts and allow pasting of URLs.
    - The app connection status to the drone controller.
- Ensure reliable and low-latency communication between the server and the drone.
- Collaborate with our team to test and refine the application for optimal performance and stability.
- Support gRPC connections over SSL for security.
- There is no need to implement any authentication.
- Please include a simple Go gRPC server to test your implementation. It is sufficient if it makes the drone take off, issue a few stick commands, saves the video frames to a file and lands the drone. Please also test the command expiry logic.
- The application will control a DJI Mini 3, but any supported Mobile SDK DJI drone should work and can be used for app development.
- The application is expected to run indefinitely with no other applications being used at the same time.

prevention.
Creating an accessible and user-friendly app or IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system for
preeclampsia involves a few key components that ensure the information is both accurate and
easily understood by a diverse audience. Here‚Äôs a structured approach to designing such a
system:
1. Target Audience
‚Ä¢ Primary Users: Pregnant individuals, family members, healthcare providers, and
caregivers.
‚Ä¢ Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to individuals with different needs, such
as visual impairments (through screen readers) and hearing impairments (with
transcripts or visual cues).
2. Core Features for the App/IVR System
Information Sections
‚Ä¢ Symptoms of Preeclampsia:
o Clear, simple explanations of common symptoms (high blood pressure, swelling,
protein in urine, headaches, visual disturbances, etc.).
o Use of simple, everyday language and audio-visual elements (in the app) like
images and infographics.
o Interactive Q&A for personalized symptom checking (for apps).
‚Ä¢ Risk Factors:
o List common risk factors (high blood pressure, age, first pregnancy, multiple
pregnancies, etc.).
o Explanation of when users should contact a doctor (in case of risk factor
identification).
‚Ä¢ Lifestyle Guidance:
o Healthy living tips during pregnancy (nutrition, exercise, stress management).
o Guidelines for monitoring and controlling blood pressure.
o Recommendations for rest and hydration.
‚Ä¢ Prevention:
o Overview of how preeclampsia can be prevented or mitigated through lifestyle
and medical care.
o Encouragement to attend regular prenatal checkups.
Personalization (for the app):
‚Ä¢ Allow users to input their age, health conditions, and pregnancy details to get
personalized information or alerts.
‚Ä¢ A checklist for ongoing health monitoring (e.g., blood pressure, swelling, etc.).
Emergency Alerts & Support:
‚Ä¢ Clear instructions on when to seek immediate medical help.
‚Ä¢ Easy access to emergency contact numbers, or the ability to connect directly to a
medical professional through the app or IVR system.
3. Designing for Accessibility
For the App:
‚Ä¢ Text-to-Speech: Use text-to-speech technology to allow users to listen to the
information.
‚Ä¢ Large Font and High Contrast Mode: Include options for users to adjust text size and
contrast for easier reading.
‚Ä¢ Multilingual Support: Provide translations for non-English-speaking users, if necessary.
‚Ä¢ Voice Commands: Allow users to navigate the app using voice commands (useful for
users with physical impairments).
‚Ä¢ Clear Navigation: Use simple, intuitive icons, large buttons, and concise wording.
‚Ä¢ Visual Cues: For example, use a color system (green, yellow, red) to indicate the severity
of symptoms or actions to take.
For the IVR System:
‚Ä¢ Simple, Clear Voice Prompts: Use natural, slow-paced speech with minimal jargon.
Use clear prompts like ""Press 1 for symptoms,"" ""Press 2 for risk factors,"" and ""Press 3 for
lifestyle guidance.""
‚Ä¢ Step-by-Step Guidance: Break down information into small chunks and provide the
option to repeat or go back.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: If users enter an incorrect option, provide a friendly prompt to guide
them back to the main menu.
‚Ä¢ Accessible for Hearing Impaired: Provide an option to switch to text-based support, or
allow users to request a call-back from a healthcare professional.
4. User Experience (UX) Design
‚Ä¢ Easy Navigation: Whether in the app or IVR, users should be able to easily navigate and
find the information they need without feeling overwhelmed.
‚Ä¢ Engaging and Reassuring Tone: Keep the language empathetic and supportive. For
example, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help you stay healthy during your pregnancy.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Regular Updates: Offer push notifications or voice prompts for important reminders,
like prenatal checkups or self-monitoring tips.
‚Ä¢ Progress Tracking: Allow users to log their symptoms or health data (like blood
pressure) and track progress over time.
5. Content Development
‚Ä¢ Accurate Information: Collaborate with obstetricians, gynecologists, and healthcare
professionals to ensure all information provided is medically accurate and evidencebased.
‚Ä¢ Simple Language: Use plain language that is easy for the general public to understand.
‚Ä¢ Multimedia Integration: In the app, include videos, images, and audio descriptions for
complex information.
‚Ä¢ Regular Review and Update: Medical guidelines change, so ensure the app or IVR is
regularly updated to reflect new research or guidelines.
6. Integration with Healthcare Providers
‚Ä¢ Direct Connection: Allow users to share information directly with their healthcare
providers (through the app) or connect with a doctor through the IVR system.
‚Ä¢ Notifications for Healthcare Providers: The app could alert a healthcare provider if a
user logs concerning symptoms.
7. Data Privacy and Security
‚Ä¢ Compliance: Ensure the app and IVR system follow relevant health privacy laws (like
HIPAA in the U.S.) to protect user data.
‚Ä¢ Secure Communication: Any sharing of health data should be encrypted and secure.
8. Testing and Feedback
‚Ä¢ User Testing: Conduct usability testing with pregnant individuals from diverse
backgrounds to ensure the app or IVR system is easy to use and accessible.
‚Ä¢ Feedback Mechanism: Allow users to provide feedback so the system can continuously
improve based on real-world use.
9. Promotion and Awareness
‚Ä¢ Work with healthcare providers, maternity centers, and public health organizations to
promote the app/IVR system to those who may benefit the most.
Great! Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the UX/UI design and some technical aspects, as well as sample
content for the app. These areas will help bring the vision for your accessible and user-friendly
app/IVR system to life.
1. UX/UI Design for the App
Key Principles for UX/UI Design:
‚Ä¢ Simplicity & Minimalism: Avoid clutter. Focus on easy-to-follow steps and a clear,
intuitive interface.
‚Ä¢ Clear and Consistent Navigation: Use familiar icons and easy-to-understand language.
Minimize the number of steps a user needs to take to access information.
‚Ä¢ Responsive Design: Ensure that the app works well on a range of devices and screen
sizes (smartphones, tablets).
‚Ä¢ Empathetic and Supportive Tone: Use language that is gentle, reassuring, and nonintimidating.
UI Components to Focus On:
‚Ä¢ Home Screen:
o Primary Navigation: Buttons for each main section (Symptoms, Risk Factors,
Prevention, Lifestyle Tips, My Health). Use large, easy-to-tap buttons with high
contrast (for visibility).
o Urgency Indicator: A prominent button or alert for ""Emergency Symptoms"" that
quickly connects the user to emergency resources or advice.
o Progress Tracking: A section that shows the user‚Äôs recent activity (e.g.,
symptoms logged, upcoming checkups) with friendly reminders like ‚ÄúYour next
appointment is tomorrow.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Symptom Checker Screen:
o Step-by-Step Guide: Let users input symptoms through yes/no questions or
checkboxes. For instance:
ÔÇß ""Do you have swelling in your hands or feet?""
ÔÇß ""Have you had any severe headaches recently?""
o Based on the answers, the system provides a risk level (e.g., low, moderate, high)
and gives personalized advice. Keep this clear and action-oriented: ‚ÄúIf you are
experiencing severe headaches, contact your healthcare provider immediately.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Information Cards:
o Symptoms, Risk Factors, Prevention: Each topic (e.g., Symptoms) could be
broken down into short, digestible cards that provide brief explanations. For
example, for ""Swelling,"" the card could read:
ÔÇß Title: ""Swelling""
ÔÇß Text: ""Swelling of the face, hands, or feet may be a sign of preeclampsia.
Monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if swelling occurs
rapidly or is accompanied by other symptoms.""
ÔÇß Action Button: ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù (Expands for more details).
‚Ä¢ Audio Features:
o Text-to-Speech: Each card or information section should have an option to be
read aloud. Include a button for this function next to the text.
o Adjustable Speech Speed: Some users may prefer slower or faster speech
rates. Include this option in the settings.
‚Ä¢ Emergency Call Button: Always present in the top-right or bottom-right corner of the
screen as a floating action button. When tapped, it should either dial emergency
services or display emergency information.
Color Scheme & Accessibility Considerations:
‚Ä¢ High Contrast: Use high contrast colors like dark text on a light background (or vice
versa) to improve readability for people with visual impairments.
‚Ä¢ Color-blind Friendly: Use color schemes that are friendly for users with color blindness
(e.g., red-green colorblind users) by incorporating patterns or text labels along with
colors to convey meaning.
‚Ä¢ Adjustable Font Sizes: Include an option in settings for users to change text size
according to their needs.
2. Technical Aspects
Tech Stack (for the app):
‚Ä¢ Frontend:
o React Native (for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android).
o Flutter (another option for cross-platform development).
o Expo (a framework for React Native to simplify the development process).
‚Ä¢ Backend:
o Node.js with Express (to build the server that manages user data, symptom
tracking, etc.).
o Firebase (for real-time database, authentication, push notifications).
‚Ä¢ Database:
o MongoDB or Firestore (for storing health-related user data securely).
o PostgreSQL (an alternative relational database).
‚Ä¢ APIs:
o Text-to-Speech API (like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or AWS Polly).
o Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications on checkups,
medication reminders, etc.).
Security and Privacy:
‚Ä¢ End-to-End Encryption: For any personal data (like health information), use encryption
to secure communication between the app and the server.
‚Ä¢ HIPAA Compliance: Ensure the app complies with healthcare privacy laws like HIPAA (if
targeting the U.S.) for managing personal health data.
‚Ä¢ User Consent: Obtain clear user consent for data collection, with the option to withdraw
consent at any time.
IVR System Considerations:
‚Ä¢ Technology Stack:
o Twilio: A popular platform for building IVR systems, capable of handling voice
prompts, user input, and connecting users to live agents or emergency services.
o Dialogflow (Google Cloud): To handle conversational AI within the IVR system for
more dynamic, natural conversations.
o Amazon Connect: An alternative for building IVR systems with integration for
advanced voice interactions.
‚Ä¢ Flow Design:
o Main Menu: ‚ÄúWelcome to the preeclampsia support system. Press 1 to learn
about symptoms, 2 for risk factors, 3 for lifestyle tips, or press 9 for emergency
assistance.‚Äù
o Submenu for Symptoms: After pressing 1: ‚ÄúDo you experience headaches?
Press 1 for Yes, Press 2 for No. Based on your answer, the system provides a
simple message and recommendation, guiding the user to the next prompt.‚Äù
o Emergency Option: ‚ÄúIf you are experiencing a medical emergency, press 9 to
connect with a healthcare provider or emergency services.‚Äù
3. Sample Content
Symptom Explanation (in-app):
‚Ä¢ Headaches: ""A headache that doesn‚Äôt go away or is unusually severe could be a sign of
preeclampsia. This may be accompanied by visual changes, such as blurred vision or
seeing spots. If you experience these symptoms, it's important to contact your
healthcare provider immediately.""
‚Ä¢ Swelling: ""Mild swelling of the feet or hands is common in pregnancy. However, sudden
swelling in the face or hands, especially if accompanied by severe headaches or vision
changes, could be a sign of preeclampsia.""
Risk Factor Explanation:
‚Ä¢ Pre-existing Hypertension: ""If you have a history of high blood pressure, you may be at a
higher risk of developing preeclampsia. Monitoring your blood pressure regularly during
pregnancy is important.""
Lifestyle Guidance:
‚Ä¢ Nutrition: ""Eating a balanced diet, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole
grains, can help you manage blood pressure and stay healthy during pregnancy.""
‚Ä¢ Rest: ""Make sure to rest when needed, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a healthcare
provider if you feel unwell.""

android_developer,Build a step counter native module for React Native / Expo,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-step-counter-native-module-for-React-Native-Expo_~021896473918892601040/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,1,Denmark,"I am looking for a very simple proof-of-concept step counter Expo app for Android phones. The app should display the amount of walked steps per day since it was started the first time. As data source you have to use Android's Sensor API. It is very important that you **DO NOT** use Google Fit or Google Health and solely rely on the value you can obtain through the Android's Sensor API (https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_motion)

**You should write a Native Module** that reads the step count via the Sensor API and makes that value available to Expo to render it on screen. Render the value centered on the screen. Black text on a white background. No need to spend time on styling, splash screen, graphics, app icon, upload to Google Play etc., as I am **ONLY** interested in the way how to access the step count from Expo.

You have to use the latest version of Expo and Kotlin (**VERY IMPORTANT**). Expo has simplified the way to create native modules through their Expo Modules API, so this link is a good starting point: https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/

## Deliveries
- Source code for the step counter app (as described above)

## Requirements
- Write your **own** native module to read the step count from the Android Sensor API
- **DO NOT** use the Google Fit or Google Health API
- **DO NOT** use the Expo Pedometer API as it is broken on Android (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/9463)
- From TypeScript you should be able to call your native module via a function like `getCurrentStepCount()` to retrieve that value. Call that function within a `setInterval()` every 5 seconds
- 1 screen showing the current step count per day on a white background in the center and nothing else, e.g. ""2025-03-01: 8.666 steps | 2025-03-02: 7.653 steps | etc.""
- When the app is terminated by the user or the Android OS the step counting has to keep working.
- **DO NOT** use a Foreground Service to avoid getting terminated by the OS, as I do not want to show a notification on screen all the time (+ it drains the battery)
- Your proof of concept app should get the current step count from the Sensor API and persist it to storage  every 15 minutes, so when the app is opened you can attribute the walked steps to the respective day. Image you do not open the app for 3 days and you still want to know how many steps where walked on each day. Maybe the WorkManager API can help here.",2,"['Smartphone', 'Android', 'iOS Development', 'iOS', 'Kotlin', 'JavaScript']",3,13.0,16.0,2.0,,0,,,400.0,1,0,0,2992.0480503341832

The app supports users by streamlining text documentation for a third-party web system. The current app records notes via our website, transcribes them using the Deepgram API, processes them with OpenAI GPT prompts for formatting, and imports the text into the third-party system‚Äôs web fields via a Chrome extension. We need this functionality to work on mobile devices (iPhone, Android, tablets) that don‚Äôt support Chrome extensions, while retaining all features, including automated field imports and a secondary ""starter phrases"" tool.

Current Workflow:

Recording & Processing: Users record notes on our website. The audio is transcribed via Deepgram API, then processed by OpenAI GPT (via multiple prompts) to sort and rewrite the text for compatibility with the target system. Processed texts are saved and organized by date for users to import.
Text Import: On the third-party web system, users click the Chrome extension icon in the browser toolbar, opening a popup with a sorted list of transcribed texts. Selecting an entry auto-fills relevant text fields, and based on the text content, it may interact with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., checking an option or selecting from a list).
Starter Phrases: With the extension installed, small icons appear in the system‚Äôs text boxes. Users click these to save or insert pre-defined ""starter phrases"" for rapid input.
Project Goals:

Build a PWA that replicates the recording, transcription, and processing workflow.
Replace the Chrome extension with a bookmarklet that works on mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome), displaying a floating overlay with sorted transcribed texts for import into the target system‚Äôs fields.
Ensure the bookmarklet can auto-fill multiple text fields, trigger checkboxes, and select dropdowns based on text content.
Adapt the ""starter phrases"" feature for mobile, either via the bookmarklet overlay or a similar mechanism.
Optimize for affordability, reliability, and mobile usability (iPhone, Android, tablets).
Key Features:

PWA Interface:
Mobile-friendly UI for recording audio notes (via browser mic access).
Integrate Deepgram API for transcription and OpenAI API for text processing (existing prompts provided).
Store and display processed texts, sorted by date (e.g., ""March 2, 2025: 10:15 AM"").
Cloud syncing (e.g., Firebase) for cross-device access.
Bookmarklet Integration:
On the third-party web system, users trigger a bookmarklet to show a floating overlay with the sorted text list.
Selecting an entry auto-fills text fields (e.g., identified by ""notes"") and interacts with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., identified by ""stable"").
Handle the system‚Äôs HTML structure (will provide sample pages or field IDs if needed).
Starter Phrases:
Replicate the text box icons as a mobile-friendly feature (e.g., overlay buttons or a separate bookmarklet mode).
Allow saving and inserting phrases into the system‚Äôs fields.
Compatibility:
Works on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome), with testing on both.
Fallback to clipboard copy/paste if the system blocks DOM manipulation.
Deliverables:

Fully functional PWA hosted on a platform like Vercel or Firebase.
Bookmarklet script with overlay UI for integration with the target system.
Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
Testing report confirming functionality on iPhone and Android with the third-party system.

Skills Required:

Web Development: Strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, or vanilla JS).
PWA Experience: Proven experience building Progressive Web Apps with responsive design, Service Workers, and offline capabilities.
Bookmarklet/DOM Manipulation: Familiarity with writing bookmarklets or scripts to interact with third-party website DOMs (e.g., querySelector, event triggers).
API Integration: Experience with REST APIs (e.g., Deepgram, OpenAI) for audio transcription and text processing.
Mobile Browser Compatibility: Knowledge of Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) quirks, including Clipboard API and mic access.
Database/Storage: Basic experience with cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) or local storage (IndexedDB).
Debugging: Ability to troubleshoot cross-browser issues and security restrictions (e.g., CSP).",3,"['AI App Development', 'AI Model Integration', 'HTML', 'Web Development', 'Payment Gateway Integration', 'CSS', 'Full-Stack Development', 'React', 'WordPress', 'WooCommerce', 'AI Agent Development', 'Web Application', 'PHP', 'JavaScript']",6,3.0,0.0,0.0,13000.0,3,2.0,0.0,30.0,0,1,0,12999.99999999999

A GERD-friendly calorie tracking mobile app designed to help users manage their dietary needs while avoiding trigger foods. The app will feature food logging, GERD-safe food identification, and dietary alignment indicators, ensuring users can make informed food choices. The UI will be modern, clean, and intuitive, with a focus on wellness rather than medical themes.

**Designs for the app have been attached.**

### **What is GERD?**

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and potential damage over time. Common symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing. Managing GERD often involves dietary adjustments to avoid trigger foods that can worsen symptoms. This app helps users make informed food choices to support their digestive health and overall well-being.

### **Technology Stack:**

- **Framework:** React Native (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Backend:** Supabase (for authentication, database management, and API services)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (for personalized food suggestions and GERD-friendly recommendations)
- **Styling:** Tailwind Native (or an equivalent style system for consistency and responsiveness)
- **External APIs:**
    - **USDA FoodData Central API** (for accurate nutritional information)
    - **OpenFoods API** (for barcode scanning and product data retrieval)
    - **OpenAI API** (for AI-powered dietary recommendations)

### **Core Features:**

1. **User Authentication:** Sign-up, login, and profile management using Supabase authentication.
2. **Food Logging:** Users can search and log food entries, tracking calories and nutritional data.
3. **GERD-Friendly Tagging:** A distinct tagging system that highlights GERD-safe and trigger foods.
4. **Dietary Alignment Indicators:** A custom visual system showing how well foods align with GERD dietary needs.
5. **AI-Powered Insights:** Personalized meal recommendations and GERD-related dietary tips powered by OpenAI.
6. **Analytics Dashboard:** Users can view trends, caloric intake, and symptom correlations.
7. **Favorites & Meal Planning:** Save favorite foods and create meal plans based on GERD-friendly options.
8. **Settings & Customization:** Allow users to adjust dietary preferences, notification settings, and tracking goals.
9. **Offline Support:** Enable food logging and basic app functionality without an internet connection.
10. **Push Notifications:** Reminders for meal logging and GERD-specific dietary guidance.
11. **Menu & Barcode Scanning:** Users can scan restaurant menus or packaged food barcodes to quickly identify GERD-friendly options and retrieve nutritional information using USDA and OpenFoods APIs.

### *Write helicopter in the first sentence of your application.

### **Deliverables:**

- Fully functional **React Native app** adhering to the outlined features.
- **Supabase backend** setup with authentication, data storage, and API integration.
- **AI-powered features** using OpenAI API for dietary recommendations.
- Integration with **USDA FoodData Central API** and **OpenFoods API** for food-related data.

The app will be tested on our farm initially, with potential for future expansion. We need a skilled Flutter developer to build a functional version with a specific interface design (see details below) and a basic web dashboard. Most of our team uses iPhones, so iOS support is required. Different sites have different bin sizes, and the app must allow users to choose the appropriate bin capacity. The home screen will list sites for selection, with administrators having the ability to edit or add new sites, including the number of bins and bin sizes, which remain static unless changed by the admin.

Mobile App (Employee View):
‚Ä¢ Home Screen: A list of existing sites (e.g., custom names) for employees to select when reporting feed levels and mortalities.
‚Ä¢ Reporting Screen:
o Single screen after site selection with a simple animated conical bin shape (based on a feed bin design, adjustable for different capacities, e.g., 15-ton default per site configuration).
o 3 drag points (red dots) to adjust the feed level interactively, with a yellow shaded area indicating the feed level.
o Real-time calculation of feed tons (e.g., 1.5T) and remaining capacity (e.g., 13.5T) based on the site‚Äôs configured bin size.
o Text display: Bin Name (e.g., Bin #1), selected Capacity (e.g., 15T), and calculations (e.g., ""Empty Space: 1.5T, Remaining Feed: 13.5T"").
o Dropdowns for Line (e.g., Line 1) specific to the selected site.
o Date field (auto-filled) and optional Notes text box.
o Mortality Tracking: Below the bin, a dropdown menu for mortality types (e.g., chronic illness, respiratory, flu) and a text box to enter the number of mortalities (e.g., ""1"" for 1 pig).
o Green ""Submit"" button.
‚Ä¢ Support for iOS (primary) and Android (secondary).
Mobile App (Administrator View):
‚Ä¢ Home Screen: Same list of sites as employees, plus an ""Admin"" button or option.
‚Ä¢ Admin Screen:
o Option to edit existing sites (e.g., update Barn Name, number of bins, bin sizes like 10T, 15T, 20T).
o Option to add new sites with configurable number of bins and bin sizes.
o Changes to bin sizes and numbers remain static unless updated by the admin.
o Simple form with save functionality, syncing to Firebase.
‚Ä¢ Admin access restricted (e.g., password or role-based login).
Web Dashboard (Farm Owner View):
‚Ä¢ Basic table listing submissions (Barn Name, Line, Date, Feed Tons, Remaining Tons, Status, Mortality Details) with thumbnails of the bin graphic, reflecting the site‚Äôs configured bin size.
‚Ä¢ Clickable details to view the adjusted bin shape, notes, mortality type, number of deaths, and status.
‚Ä¢ Status toggle (Pending/Ordered).
‚Ä¢ Admin option to edit site configurations (same as mobile admin screen).
Technical Details:
‚Ä¢ Use Firebase for real-time data syncing between mobile and web.
‚Ä¢ Target iOS primarily (delivered as .ipa file), with Android (.apk) as a secondary option.
‚Ä¢ Simple, functional design based on the attached reference image (conical bin with 3 drag points).
‚Ä¢ Implement a site setup feature to assign different bin sizes (e.g., 10T, 15T, 20T) and number of bins per site, editable only by admins.
‚Ä¢ Store site configurations, bin data, and mortality data in Firebase.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Working mobile app (iOS .ipa and Android .apk) with employee and admin modes.
‚Ä¢ Web dashboard.
‚Ä¢ Source code with comments.
‚Ä¢ Basic testing and bug fixes on iOS.
Timeline
‚Ä¢ Estimated 70-100 hours over 3-4 weeks.
‚Ä¢ Milestones:
o 25% upfront upon contract signing.
o 50% after mobile app completion (iOS focus).
o 25% after web dashboard and final testing.
Budget
‚Ä¢ $3,500 - $5,000 total, negotiable based on experience and timeline.
‚Ä¢ Prefer fixed-price, but open to hourly (max $50/hour).
How to Apply
‚Ä¢ Submit a proposal with:
o Brief overview of your Flutter experience.
o Link to portfolio (e.g., GitHub, app demos).
o Estimated timeline and cost within the budget.
o Any questions or suggestions for the project.
‚Ä¢ Attach or reference the provided image for design inspiration.

The main goal is to help users (primarily students) create and study flashcards, summaries, and quizzes, with the option to generate them automatically from uploaded PDFs, images, or text.

Below is an overview of the functionality I‚Äôd like implemented:
1. User Registration and Profiles
Sign Up / Log In: Standard email/password or social logins.
Profile Settings: Basic information, notification preferences, and language settings.

2. Flashcard Creation & Management
Manual Creation: Users can manually add flashcards (front/back or question/answer) with formatting (bold, italics, etc.).
Automated Generation: Users can upload a file or paste text, and the app should parse it to identify key concepts. Automatically create flashcards from that content (similar to mindgrasp.ai or Vaia).

3. Flashcard Library
Organized Sets: Users can group flashcards into themed sets or subjects (like Quizlet).
Search & Filter: By title, subject, difficulty, or date created.
Share Options (optional, if time permits): Let users share sets with friends or make them public.

4. Study & Quiz Features
Flip-Based Study: Show front side first, then reveal the answer on the back (like traditional flashcards).
Difficulty/Confidence Rating: After viewing an answer, user labels how easy or hard it was. This data can feed a spaced repetition algorithm so that harder cards appear more frequently.
Progress Tracking: Display how many cards are left, correct/incorrect counts, or a progress bar.
Multiple Question Types (optional): If possible, beyond just ‚Äúflip cards,‚Äù we might introduce multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

5. AI/Spaced Repetition Integration
Adaptive Scheduling: Cards rated ‚Äúhard‚Äù appear more often than easier ones (similar to Anki).
Summaries & Key Concepts: If possible, incorporate an AI summarizer that condenses large pieces of text into bullet points or potential Q&A pairs.

6. User Experience & Interface
Clean, Intuitive UI: Reference Quizlet‚Äôs minimal approach.
Visual Cues: Simple icons for flipping cards, rating difficulty, or uploading documents (similar to Vaia‚Äôs design style).

However, due to Lovable.dev‚Äôs limitations on collaboration, I‚Äôd like to work closely with someone throughout the process rather than just handing over the project.

This means I‚Äôm looking for someone who can not only help implement solutions but also guide me along the way, explaining what‚Äôs happening and how I can make better technical decisions in the future. I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúdone-for-you‚Äù approach‚ÄîI want to understand the changes being made and what I could do differently next time.

Project Overview:

I‚Äôve built an app that enables quick, on-the-fly proposal creation during sales calls. These proposals can be updated post-call, shared via live links, and compared side-by-side. However, I need help solving a few major challenges:

Key Challenges to Solve:
1. Optimize Shared Results Load Time
‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúShared Results‚Äù page, which displays past proposals, takes too long to load (sometimes over 1.5 minutes).
‚Ä¢ It includes details such as proposal creator, assignee, attendees, creation date, status (draft/published), and actions (edit, delete, copy, view).
‚Ä¢ I need improvements in query efficiency and performance to make this load faster.
2. Fix OpenAI Integration for Proposal Summaries
‚Ä¢ The proposal editor includes a ‚ÄúGenerate Summary‚Äù feature that should extract key details from a transcript via OpenAI.
‚Ä¢ The summary sections include:
‚Ä¢ Introduction
‚Ä¢ Solution Overview
‚Ä¢ Current Situation
‚Ä¢ Future Goals
‚Ä¢ Challenges
‚Ä¢ Currently, generating summaries fails with the error: ‚ÄúAnalysis error. Failed to send a request to the edge function.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ I need help diagnosing whether this is an issue with my Supabase edge function or the OpenAI API request.
3. Potential Expansion: AI Demo System
‚Ä¢ I have a table containing URLs for live AI demos that simulate real-world AI chat experiences.
‚Ä¢ I want to create a searchable demo experience where users can select an industry and test AI interactions relevant to their needs.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm unsure whether this should be a separate project or an extension of my current system. I‚Äôd love input on the best approach.

Ideal Skills & Experience:
‚Ä¢ Supabase: Experience optimizing queries and edge functions.
‚Ä¢ OpenAI API: Familiarity with integrating AI-driven text generation.
‚Ä¢ Full-Stack Development: Strong background in backend optimization and UI performance.
‚Ä¢ Database Performance Optimization: Ability to debug slow-loading pages and speed up data retrieval.
‚Ä¢ Mentorship & Collaboration: Willingness to walk me through the process, answer questions, and explain decisions.
‚Ä¢ Experience with AI Demos (Optional): If you have experience building interactive AI showcases, that‚Äôs a bonus.

Next Steps:

If this sounds like a project you can help with, please include:
‚Ä¢ A brief explanation of how you would approach fixing the slow-loading shared results page.
‚Ä¢ Your experience with Supabase edge functions and OpenAI API integrations.
‚Ä¢ Any thoughts on whether the AI demo system should be a separate project or an extension of the current app.
‚Ä¢ Your experience with mentoring or coaching developers through technical challenges.

This survey targets people who work as Mechanical Engineers or had experience in this area before. Please ensure you satisfy this requirement before you participate in this study.

What are AI agents?

An AI agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing certain tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.

Why Participate in This Survey?

While there have been many hypes about AI agents, most discussions focus on full automation. It is unclear how these agents could support individual workers and what is the best way of incorporating these agents in users' workflows. Your participation will help us better understand how to develop AI agents that enhance human work in ways that truly benefit workers.

What Will You Do?

This survey consists of three parts:

1. Share your occupation and daily workflow (we make this part of the survey interactive and more engaging - just like a small interview!)

2. Based on your answers in the previous part, you will see specific tasks from your work. For each task, you will need to answer the same set of rating questions.

This will require full time work, prioritized to this project until completion.

The project: Clients.ai ‚Äì an AI-powered marketing automation platform that handles outreach, follow-ups, and client management. It‚Äôs almost there, but key features need to be finished, optimized, and refined.

If you‚Äôve built React (JSX/TSX) + Node.js (Express) + PostgreSQL applications before, you‚Äôll understand what needs to be done.

What‚Äôs on Your Desk?
The Frontend: Built in React (JSX/TSX) with Tailwind. The foundation is solid. The UI is mostly complete. What‚Äôs missing?

UI Consistency & Small Fixes: Standardize margins, fonts, and button placements across key pages (login, signup, dashboard). Minor copy edits for clarity and professionalism. Add missing headers, footers, and functional buttons/links.

Payment & Subscription Automation: Implement Stripe‚Äôs 18-day trial, automate free-year access for webinar buyers, and refine billing management (subscription control, conversion core purchases, and billing history).

Campaign & Dashboard Stability: Ensure campaigns track leads correctly, allow full editing (name, offer details, testimonials, etc.), and integrate seamless opt-in form generation. Fix dashboard inconsistencies in stats, campaign status updates, and active lead counts.

Email & API Integration: Improve email templates for clarity and branding. Ensure users can send emails via their own SMTP without external branding. Implement API integrations for seamless CRM sync.

Performance & UX Enhancements: Speed up form submissions, ensure real-time text generation works properly, improve animations for AI-driven data collection, and fix any broken UI/UX elements for a smooth, intuitive experience.

(I will provide a complete list after you have been vetted.

The Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL. It works, but some queries need optimization, API responses need to be snappier, and real-time communication could be improved.
The Database: PostgreSQL. The schema is in place. Some queries need performance tuning.


Finish the Members Area: It‚Äôs functional, but some logic is incomplete. UI interactions need final touches. Personalization features need polish.

Optimize Backend Performance: Some API calls are slower than they should be. Some queries are doing more work than necessary. You'll find the inefficiencies and clean them up.

Fix the ‚ÄúLittle Things‚Äù That Make a Big Difference.

React (JSX/TSX) ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt know JSX/TSX inside-out, this isn‚Äôt for you.
Node.js (Express) ‚Äì You‚Äôll be working with API endpoints and making them faster.
PostgreSQL ‚Äì You need to be comfortable optimizing queries and database performance.
Tailwind CSS ‚Äì The styling is mostly in place, but any UI fixes should be in line with it.
The Right Developer For This Job:
Sees the Whole Picture ‚Äì You‚Äôre not just writing code. You understand how data should flow between the frontend and backend.
Fixes First, Optimizes Second ‚Äì First, get everything working as it should. Then, make it faster.
Understands Real-Time Data Handling ‚Äì We‚Äôre fetching updates dynamically, without the user noticing. You need to make that work seamlessly.
Works Without Hand-Holding ‚Äì You‚Äôll get access to the repo, the existing code, and a list of the known issues. Beyond that, you‚Äôll need to figure things out and make decisions.

The Wrong Developer for This Job:
If you need someone to tell you exactly what to do next, you‚Äôll struggle here.
If you build things that work ‚Äúmost of the time‚Äù but not always, that won‚Äôt cut it.
If you write code that works but is hard to maintain, this isn‚Äôt the place for you.

üí° Show us your GitHub, past work, or relevant examples (no generic resumes).

üìå What do I need? I have an illustration of a character created by my designer, and I want to generate different poses of the same character while maintaining the exact same style. The AI should be able to recreate it with variations such as:

‚úÖ Looking at a phone üì±
‚úÖ Thinking ü§î
‚úÖ Smiling üòÄ
‚úÖ Jumping üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
‚úÖ And more

It is crucial that the result is consistent and true to the original style, not just a rough approximation.

üìå Why? This will save me time and make content creation easier without relying on my designer to manually draw every single pose. If this process works well for this first character, I plan to replicate it with others in my collection.

‚úîÔ∏è Real experience in AI training for image generation.
‚úîÔ∏è Ability to explain the process or teach me how to use the trained AI.
‚úîÔ∏è A method that allows me to reuse the AI with other characters in the future.

Fine-tune LLM for Language Translation
This assignment will challenge your ability to fine-tune a large language model, evaluate
its performance, and use LLM to generate synthesized data for a specific task. It will also
demonstrate your ability to write effective prompts for the assigned task. Additionally, it
will test your research and design skills for the task.
Task Description
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to fine-tune a model to
enhance its performance for a specific task. Also, it will show how existing large language
models can be used in the data collection process to enhance relatively smaller models.
This will involve:
‚Ä¢ Selecting an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning a model for language translation
‚Ä¢ Choosing a small pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned within a free Google
Colab notebook (T4 GPU, 15 GB VRAM, 12.7 GB RAM).
‚Ä¢ Designing the experimental setup and evaluation metrics.
‚Ä¢ Crafting an effective prompt to generate synthetic data for dataset expansion.
Research Phase
In the research phase, you will do an investigation to select two things:
‚óè A benchmark dataset [Dataset A] with pairs of inputs for the German - French
language translation. The dataset should contain at least 1,000 pairs. If it contains
more, randomly select 1,000 pairs.
‚óè A relatively small model [Model A] -not less than 1B parameters in size- that
could be tuned on Colab notebook setup with any tuning approach you studied
during the lectures. The model must be a pre-trained general-purpose large
language model in the first step and not a language translation model or a model
with random weights.
Note: We are always here to help. If you have any question during this phase, do not
hesitate to ask.
Design Phase
During this phase, you will need to decide which approach of fine-tuning you will use
based on the size of your model and the available computation you have in the Colab
notebook setup. In addition, you will need to decide the suitable split ratio between the
training [Dataset A: Train] and testing [Dataset A: Test] datasets in your benchmark
dataset. You will also need to create a suitable prompt for querying a large model with at
least 32B parameters, such as Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, to generate synthetic
data for expanding your training dataset. Furthermore, you will need to decide on a
suitable evaluation metric to evaluate all model‚Äôs performance on the targeted task.
Implementation Phase
Use a Python Colab notebook with a T4 GPU (15 GB VRAM, 12.7 GB RAM) to implement
your solution, adding clear explanations in the notebook cells for easy understanding of
your code. For each result, provide the appropriate explanation:
1. 2. 3. 4. Load [Dataset A] and split it according to the designed ratio.
Load your chosen pre-trained model [Model A].
Evaluate [Model A] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
Fine-tune [Model A] on the training dataset [Dataset A: Train] to create [Model
B].
5. Evaluate [Model B] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
6. Use the designed prompt to generate a new synthesized dataset [Dataset B],
twice the size of the training set [Dataset A: Train], using the selected larger
model.
7. 8. 9. Fine-tune [Model A] on the synthesized dataset [Dataset B] to create [Model C].
Evaluate [Model C] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
Combine [Dataset A: Train] and [Dataset B], shuffle them with suitable seeds,
and create [Dataset C].
10. Fine-tune [Model A] on the combined dataset [Dataset C] to create [Model D].
11. Evaluate [Model D] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
12. Plot the performance of all models using appropriate visualizations.
Stretch Goal (for up to 10 additional points):
‚óè Pick the best model performance and design a simple interface to query it using
your favourite technology (Example: Streamlit).

We‚Äôre looking for a Python and Machine Learning expert to build the core visualization engine for an AI-powered floor replacement tool‚Äîthink along the lines of HomeDesigns.ai Floor Editor or Winstars.ai Flooring Designer. This gig is all about the backend visualization: take an uploaded room image, detect the floor, and swap it with a custom texture, keeping it lean and cost-effective on a server. No fancy frontend‚Äîjust a simple Python UI for testing.

**Here‚Äôs what we need:

Core Task: Use Python and OpenCV to detect floors and replace them with a custom tiled image we provide.

AI Models: Leverage or fine-tune lightweight ML models (e.g., segmentation) for accurate floor detection‚Äîgood enough to keep things clean and precise. TensorFlow or PyTorch are our go-tos.

Server Efficiency: Deploy it on a low-cost server (like a small AWS/GCP instance). We want a solid balance of speed and accuracy without racking up big server bills‚Äîefficiency is the name of the game.

Simple UI: Build a basic Python UI (e.g., Tkinter or a script) so we can upload an image, select a texture, and tweak it‚Äîspecifically, resize and rotate the tile/texture to fit the room. Nothing flashy, just functional.

Success Looks Like: The final image has no (or barely any) artifacting‚Äîclean edges, no weird glitches. The texture‚Äôs perspective matches the room realistically, like it belongs there. Plus, we can adjust the tile/texture size and rotation for a perfect fit.

**What We‚Äôre Looking For:

Strong Python and OpenCV skills‚Äîfloor detection and texture replacement should be second nature to you.

Experience with lightweight ML models (e.g., U-Net, MobileNet) that deliver accuracy without eating resources.

Know-how to deploy on a server and keep costs low‚Äîthink CPU-friendly or minimal GPU, maybe some model optimization tricks like quantization.

Ability to whip up a simple Python GUI that lets us resize and rotate textures on the fly.

A practical approach to hit our success criteria‚Äîclean output, realistic perspective, and flexible textures‚Äîwithout overcomplicating things.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in AWS and experience using Bedrock's LLM, along with TTS and STT technologies. Your expertise will help us create a seamless conversational agent that effectively engages users. Join us in pushing the boundaries of AI interaction!
Here's a high-level proof of concept (POC) for integrating your existing chatbot with AWS for data storage and retrieval:

*Architecture Overview*
1. User interacts with the chatbot through a frontend application (web or mobile or link sent as sms).
2. The chatbot uses AI  to understand user inputs and respond accordingly. The interface has LLM selection and voice selection but it will be removed, and my application will be used for settings.
3. User inputs are stored in an AWS database ( RDS).
4. The chatbot retrieves user data from the AWS database using a reference number if it is a previous client or gives a new reference number for a new client.
5. The chatbot integrates with a RAG and prompt system connected to the frontend application via settings.

*Technical Requirements*
1. *Chatbot Framework*: i already have full codes that is functional that uses LLM and voice selection but not refined and not integrated. So i need you to refine my existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services, you will work with my AWS team and they will help in integration as I already have other AI integrated.
2. *AWS Services*:
    - **: Store user data and conversation history, that will be my AWS team.
    
    - *API *: Handle incoming requests from the frontend application.
3. *Frontend Application*: Integrate with the chatbot using APIs and display chatbot responses.
4. *RAG and Prompt System*: Integrate with the frontend application and provide prompts to the user again I have the application team for that.

*Integration Steps*
1. *Refine Chatbot Code*: Update the existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services.
2. *work with AWS team*.
3. *Integrate Chatbot with AWS*:
4. *Integrate Chatbot with Frontend Application*: Use APIs to integrate the chatbot with the frontend application for RAG, prompt, voice and llm selection.
5. *Test and Deploy*: Test the integrated system and deploy it to production.

*Reference Number Implementation*
1. *Generate Reference Number*: When a user starts the application, generate a unique reference number.
2. *Store Reference Number*: Store the reference number in the AWS database along with user data.
3. *Retrieve User Data*: When a user returns to the application, use the reference number to retrieve their user data from the AWS database.

*Multimodal Interaction (Text and Voice)*
1. *Text Input*: Handle text input from the user and respond with text and voice output.
2. *Voice Output*: Use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to generate voice output for user responses.

So I have a full built frontend application for conversation AI. That frontend has LLM and voice selection feature. That frontend is connected with my AWS rds. I just want to use what we currently have but want your expertise for the chatbot AI part of it

Job Summary

We are seeking a highly skilled Machine Learning Engineer to develop and deploy a self-supervised predictive ML model on AWS SageMaker that identifies the Top N products from an input CSV that are:
X
Y
Z

The model should be self-supervised, meaning it should automatically learn from new data without requiring manually labeled training samples. This approach will enable the system to continuously improve its predictions over time by identifying patterns from historical and incoming sales, pricing, and inventory data.

The ideal candidate should have expertise in self-supervised learning, time-series forecasting, feature learning, and AWS ML deployment.

Key Responsibilities
1. Self-Supervised Machine Learning Model Development

Design and implement a self-supervised ML model that detects products likely to sell out within 30-45 days, based on past trends and real-time data.
Develop an unsupervised feature learning mechanism that extracts patterns from sales velocity, price fluctuations, seasonality, and competition levels.
Implement contrastive learning, representation learning, and clustering-based techniques to enable the model to find patterns in unlabeled data.
Incorporate a profitability formula that factors in Amazon‚Äôs referral fees (15%), packaging/shipping costs ($7 per unit), and supplier shipping costs.
2. Data Engineering & Self-Supervised Feature Extraction

Automate feature learning from CSV files, Amazon APIs, and external data sources (e.g., Keepa, CamelCamelCamel).
Extract and process features such as moving averages, seasonality indicators, price elasticity, stock depletion rate, and competition density without human-labeled data.
Build a self-supervised training pipeline where the model continuously updates itself using historical and real-time data without manual intervention.
Store and manage structured datasets using AWS S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon DynamoDB.
3. AWS Deployment & Automated Model Training

Deploy the self-supervised ML model on AWS SageMaker, enabling automated inference and model updates.
Implement an AWS Lambda pipeline that triggers model retraining when new data is added.
Use SageMaker‚Äôs AutoML, serverless inference, and batch transformation for real-time and scheduled predictions.
Optimize the system for scalability using parallel data processing and distributed model training.
4. Model Evaluation & Continuous Learning

Monitor model performance using unsupervised evaluation metrics such as:
‚úÖ Anomaly detection for unexpected trends
‚úÖ Clustering consistency scores
‚úÖ Self-labeling accuracy on inferred stockout risks
Retrain the model dynamically by feeding in new unlabeled data and allowing the system to refine predictions.
Implement AWS CloudWatch alerts to notify when the model confidence drops or anomalies are detected.
5. Intelligent Decision-Making & Business Impact

Generate automated reports ranking the Top N products that sellers should focus on.
Ensure that the model detects low-competition, high-margin products, giving sellers a competitive advantage.
Enable the business to automate restocking decisions, avoiding lost revenue due to stockouts and price misjudgments.
Required Qualifications & Skills
Machine Learning & AI Expertise

Strong experience in self-supervised learning techniques (e.g., contrastive learning, clustering-based learning, anomaly detection, autoencoders).
Experience with time-series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTMs) and unsupervised feature engineering.

Data Engineering: Experience handling large CSV datasets, cloud storage, and database management (DynamoDB, Redshift, or PostgreSQL).

Automation & CI/CD: Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and auto-scaling AWS services.
Soft Skills

Ability to work in a fully automated, AI-driven environment with minimal human supervision.

Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a research-driven approach.

Excellent communication skills to translate self-supervised ML insights into business actions.

Preferred Qualifications

Experience with Amazon Seller Central APIs and third-party tools for competitor analysis (e.g., Keepa, CamelCamelCamel).

Knowledge of reinforcement learning for improving inventory strategies.

Prior experience with AutoML frameworks for self-improving ML models.

Overview

We propose developing an AI-powered platform that automates the analysis of legal orders and regulations, offering temporal and semantic insights through natural language search. This solution will help businesses, legal professionals, and policymakers navigate complex regulatory landscapes efficiently.

Problem Statement

Regulatory compliance and legal research are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Legal professionals spend countless hours parsing through vast amounts of legislative texts, amendments, and case laws to derive meaningful insights. This creates:
‚Ä¢ Compliance Risks: Businesses struggle to keep up with evolving laws, leading to potential penalties.
‚Ä¢ Inefficiency: Manual legal research is costly and slow.
‚Ä¢ Lack of Contextual Understanding: Existing legal databases provide text search but lack deep reasoning capabilities.

Solution

Our AI-driven platform will:
1. Ingest & Structure Legal Data
‚Ä¢ Parse and index thousands of legal documents (orders, statutes, regulations)
‚Ä¢ Build a legal knowledge graph for tracking amendments, dependencies, and contradictions
‚Ä¢ Use vector embeddings & NLP models to create contextual representations of laws
2. Enable Advanced Legal Reasoning
‚Ä¢ Identify temporal relationships (precedence, repeals, amendments)
‚Ä¢ Detect semantic relationships (contradictions, citations, modifications)
‚Ä¢ Provide a natural language search interface for retrieving relevant legal information with just a question
3. Deliver Actionable Insights
‚Ä¢ Generate explainable legal impact analysis
‚Ä¢ Offer trend predictions on regulatory shifts
‚Ä¢ Integrate with enterprise compliance systems to alert businesses on new regulatory risks



Business Model
‚Ä¢ Subscription-Based SaaS: Access to the legal intelligence platform
‚Ä¢ API Licensing: Integration with legal research & compliance tools
‚Ä¢ Enterprise Consulting: Custom models for large corporations & law firms

Competitive Advantage
‚Ä¢ Unlike traditional legal databases  our solution maps relationships between laws dynamically, allowing for real-time legal impact analysis.
‚Ä¢ Unlike generic LLMs, our system is fine-tuned for legal reasoning, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
‚Ä¢ Multi-jurisdiction support, enabling businesses to navigate cross-border regulations seamlessly.


This platform represents the next generation of AI-powered legal intelligence, transforming how businesses and legal professionals engage with complex regulations. With the right backing, we can disrupt the traditional legal research market and establish a new industry standard for regulatory analysis.",3,"['Google Cloud Platform', 'NestJS', 'Web Development', 'Discord', 'Web Design', 'Full-Stack Development', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'React', 'SQL', 'Python', 'PyTorch', 'Marketing Strategy', 'Node.js', 'Database Management', 'MongoDB', 'Neo4j', 'WordPress']",2,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,3,3.0,2.0,36.0,0,0,1,49.99999999999999

The goal is to automate initial customer interactions, schedule appointments based on location, and integrate this data into the Markate CRM. The system should be seamless and feel human-like.

1. AI-Powered Texting Bot
- Functionality:
  - When a customer texts or calls, the AI bot will respond as if it were Brandon.
  - If a call is missed, the bot automatically sends:  
    *""Hey this is Brandon! Sorry for missing your call, I'm in a customer's house... Are you able to text? How can I help?""*
  - The bot should respond naturally and guide customers to schedule an appointment via a Calendly link.
  - Ensure the bot does NOT reveal it is AI.
  - Train the AI on Brandon's usual responses and tone to maintain authenticity.
  - **Brandon must have access to manually respond if needed.**

- Requirements:
  - AI model trained on Brandon‚Äôs past interactions.
  - API integration for SMS (Twilio recommended).
  - Ability to detect when a customer calls and trigger auto-text.
  - A manual override option for Brandon to take over the conversation if necessary.

---

2. Smart Scheduling via Calendly
- **Functionality:**
  - Customers will be directed to a scheduling link where they choose their city.
  - Cities: City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4.
  - Each hourly block should have **two slots** available.

- Requirements:
  - A dynamic Calendly setup with city-based scheduling.
  - API integration to categorize bookings based on city selection.

---

3. Markate CRM Integration
- **Functionality:**
  - Once a customer schedules an appointment via Calendly, their details need to be automatically entered into the **Leads** section of Markate CRM.
  - Brandon will manually move the lead to a ""Free Estimate"" slot in Markate.

- Challenges & Workarounds:
  - Markate doesn‚Äôt have a fully customizable API.
  - Data should be pushed into Markate‚Äôs existing Lead system through an automation tool like Zapier or Make.com.

- Requirements:
  - API integration (or webhooks) to push Calendly bookings into Markate.
  - Ensure customer name, phone number, and appointment details are properly mapped.

---

4. Lead Notification System
- **Functionality:**
  - When a lead books an appointment via Calendly, Brandon should receive a **text notification** with the lead‚Äôs details and appointment day.
  - The text should remind Brandon to **adjust the lead‚Äôs time slot** in Markate manually.

- Requirements:
  - SMS notification to Brandon‚Äôs personal phone when a new lead is created.
  - The text should include: Customer Name, Phone Number, Selected City, and Scheduled Date/Time.

---

Final Notes:
- The entire system must work **seamlessly and without friction** for the customer.
- The AI bot must feel **human-like** and **not robotic**.
- Automations should reduce manual input as much as possible while keeping Brandon in control of final scheduling.
- **Brandon must be able to manually intervene in AI conversations when necessary.**

Tools Required:
- Twilio (for AI texting & SMS notifications)
- Calendly (for scheduling)
- Markate CRM (for lead management)
- Zapier/Make.com (for integrations if direct API isn‚Äôt available)

The chat bot can either give the answer with natural language, or could pull up a list of forum posts that may be the same question the user is asking and let the user selected which one to open that thread.

The best case scenario would be a chat bot which gave an answer that was already answered by one of our pro moderators from the past and told the user that they should submit a new question if no match or similar question has been asked yet ‚Äî but it should only say that if truly no similar question has been asked yet and should be capable of knowing when the same or a similar question has been asked previously.

UrbanChat is a scalable AI voice agent platform that allows businesses to sign up and build their own AI voice agents to handle customer calls. It works similarly to Retell AI, providing a fully automated AI-powered call-handling solution.

Our current setup integrates Twilio for telephony, ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech TTS, OpenAI Realtime 4o Mini for Speech-to-Text STT and LLM Natural Language Processing.

We want to restructure our architecture to be highly modular and flexible, allowing us to easily integrate multiple providers for each component without modifying the core backend.

Project Overview
Currently, our AI voice agent relies on:
‚úÖ Telephony ‚Äì Twilio for making and receiving calls
‚úÖ TTS ‚Äì ElevenLabs for AI-generated speech
‚úÖ STT ‚Äì OpenAI Realtime for transcribing user speech
‚úÖ LLM ‚Äì OpenAI for conversation intelligence

We want to decouple each of these components into separate modular frameworks, making it easy to integrate alternative providers without affecting other parts of the system.

Goals of This Project
Build a modular and scalable framework for Telephony, TTS, STT, and LLM.
Ensure that new providers can be added or swapped with minimal backend changes.
Maintain latency under 1000ms for real-time conversations.
Work on the existing codebase and refactor where needed.
Prepare comprehensive documentation including APIs and integration guidelines.
Your Role
You will be responsible for designing and implementing a modular architecture for the AI voice agent. This will involve breaking down the system into four independent frameworks:

1. Telephony Framework
Currently using Twilio, but should support other providers like Vonage, Exotel, etc.
Abstract call-handling logic so that switching providers requires minimal code changes.
Maintain lowest-latency communication between telephony and the AI engine.
Ensure compatibility with SIP, WebRTC, and standard telephony APIs.
Provide APIs for call initiation, phone number purchase, call handling, and termination.
From the backend, if we need to add another service provider, we should be able to integrate their API, and their phone numbers will be available for purchase on the frontend. This means customers can buy numbers from different providers directly through our platform.

2 TTS Text-to-Speech Framework
Currently using ElevenLabs, but should support Sarvam AI, Deepgram, Google TTS, etc.
Implement a standardized API for different TTS providers.
Ensure real-time streaming support for seamless voice interactions.
Optimize for low-latency response generation below 1000ms.
Provide fallback mechanisms in case a provider fails.

3 STT Speech-to-Text Framework
Currently using OpenAI Realtime, but should support Deepgram, Whisper, Google STT, etc.
Implement a plug-and-play interface for STT providers.
Maintain high transcription accuracy and low latency.
Support real-time streaming transcription for conversational AI.
Optimize handling of different accents, noise levels, and speech variations.

4 LLM AI Engine Framework
Currently using OpenAI GPT-4o Mini, but should support Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.
Design an API wrapper that allows switching between different AI models with minimal effort.
Optimize response generation for low latency and high conversation quality.
Support context-aware memory and multi-turn conversations.
Implement a fallback system in case of API failures or rate limits.

Expectations and Deliverables
‚úÖ Modular Architecture
Each framework should be built as an independent module with a standardized API, so we can integrate any provider in the future with minimal changes.

‚úÖ Real-Time Optimization
The entire system must maintain end-to-end latency under 1000ms, ensuring a smooth conversation experience.

‚úÖ Code Refactoring and Integration
You will be working on our existing codebase, improving structure and modularity without breaking functionality.

‚úÖ Comprehensive Documentation

Full API documentation for each framework.
Step-by-step guides for adding new providers.
Code structure explanations for future developers.

The sheet aims to integrate various data inputs‚Äîoccupancy, average daily rates (ADR), and comp set percentile positions‚Äîinto a streamlined, automated Google Sheets environment.

I previously worked with another freelancer on this project, but due to timing, we were unable to finalize the solution. I now need a reliable expert who can pick up and improve upon existing google sheet files and deliver a robust, user-friendly tool that my team and I can easily maintain.

Background

Objective: Build an automated system in Google Sheets to project short-term rental pricing across weekdays, weekends, and holidays while factoring in occupancy and ‚Äúcomp set‚Äù percentile positioning. There are three more tabs that are laid out but need formulas to connect the backend data dump as well.

Existing Assets:
Multiple partially completed Google Sheets with tabular logic, occupant-based formulas, and references to comp set percentile data.
A script meant to handle CSV imports (e.g., 12 to 18 months of historical and upcoming data) but needs debugging and enhancement.
Loom videos demonstrating the initial approach, formulas, and advanced tasks (e.g., capturing the ‚Äúrelevant price percentile ADR,‚Äù pulling in occupancy data, etc.).
CSV files containing raw occupancy and revenue data for multiple listings.

What I Need Done:
Data Import & Parsing
Finalize or rebuild the script that ingests CSV data (12‚Äì18 months‚Äô worth), correctly handles duplicated months, and appends or overwrites existing data as necessary.
Ensure the import script can be triggered on-demand by a button or menu item in Google Sheets.
Dynamic Pricing Formula

Create (or refine) formulas that incorporate separate logic for weekdays vs. weekends/holidays.

Dashboard & Visualization

Develop a dedicated ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù tab pulling from the processed data to display (90% done):

Testing & Validation

Thoroughly test the final formulas and scripts using sample CSV data for accuracy and ease of use.
Provide clear instructions or Loom videos explaining how to maintain and adjust the system.

Deliverables
One fully working Google Sheet:
Automated CSV Import Script
Clean, well-labeled pricing logic and formulas for accurate data analysis and adjustments.

Ideal Freelancer
Expert in Google Sheets (queries, array formulas, scripts in Apps Script).
Familiar with short-term rental revenue management (occupancy, ADR, comp sets, dynamic pricing concepts).
Excellent communication‚Äîwilling to provide Looms or detailed instructions on how to use the tool.
Proactive problem-solver who can suggest best practices for automation and clarity.

Timeline: Prefer a 2‚Äì3 week turnaround, with frequent check-ins or milestone deliveries to ensure alignment.

How to Apply
Relevant Experience: Share any related Google Sheets, formuals, and automation you‚Äôve completed.

Availability: When can you start, and how soon could you deliver a first draft?

We‚Äôll schedule a short introductory call after reviewing proposals to clarify the scope, walk you through the partial Sheet we have, and confirm next steps.

Provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the spreadsheet operates, including all formulas, linked data sources, and automation processes.

Explain the methodology behind how data is updated, including any scripts, macros, or external integrations involved.

Outline any dependencies on third-party data sources or software tools.

Include any insights or best practices that would ensure the smooth internal operation of this spreadsheet.

Provide a rationale for why these additional data points may be valuable.

4. Vendor Data Sources & Input Analysis

Investigate and document where the current vendor sources the data they input into the spreadsheet.

Detail the frequency and process of data collection and entry.

Identify any manual versus automated data input methods.

5. Access and Additional Resources

You will be granted access to our Local Services Ads (LSA) to review relevant data and processes directly.

It will function somewhat as an interview, because I would like this person to stay on for the ongoing engagement.

This project will be used to help us identify real estate investment opportunities and so data accuracy is critical. We need someone who is focused on the impact and quality of the analysis more than we need speed. As such, I would like your estimate of what it costs to complete this, but would prefer to pay by the hour, to improve alignment, and encourage discussion and collaboration between us while you work.

I don‚Äôt expect one person to be able to be able to do all of these, but the more coverage one person can provide the better. Relatedly, I‚Äôm interested in people who have existing relationships with other developers/data analysts who they can work with to take on more of the project as a team, to the extent needed.

For the initial project, I want to develop a raster map of the United States with each point containing the total population within a 3-mile radius of said point.

I‚Äôm open to suggestions for how to approach this, but my initial thinking is as follows:
‚Ä¢ Pull population data from the US Census by Census Block (or open to suggestions for better sources)
‚Ä¢ Pull Census Block polygons/boundaries, which I assume are also available on the Census website
‚Ä¢ Convert population numbers to population densities.
    o The census tracks block areas with and without water areas included. Ideally, you can convert water areas to ‚Äúzero population‚Äù in the raster, and show the remaining points as the population density excluding bodies of water.
    o I‚Äôm very much open to suggestions for better ways to estimate population densities.
‚Ä¢ With a pixelized map of the population density of the United States, add together the resulting population within three miles of each point.

Again if you see a better way to accomplish this, please let me know!

I will eventually want to take a more advanced approach here to estimating the distributions of populations within Census Block groups, so would like to hear any suggestions you might have on ways to approach this.

Project description:
We have a dataset of approximately 30,000 rows based on invoices, containing CO‚ÇÇ data, supplier information, costs, and various classifications. Our goal is to build an impactful and highly useful dashboard in Looker that not only provides a high-level summary of sustainability data but also enables deep analytical exploration (drill-downs).

What we need help with:
- Strategic setup & integration: You should be familiar with Google Cloud Platform and Looker (data is stored in BigQuery) to ensure a smooth and effective setup. However, getting everything ‚Äòtechnically perfect‚Äô is less important than ensuring the data delivers valuable insights.
- Dashboard & visualization: Develop a clear and actionable dashboard that highlights key sustainability metrics (e.g., total CO‚ÇÇ, costs, supplier overview) while allowing users to drill down into specific areas for deeper analysis.
- Analytical approach: We need someone who goes beyond the technical setup and can think about what questions the data should answer. You will be expected to contribute ideas on which key metrics, dimensions, and analyses matter most for understanding and improving sustainability efforts.
- Advisory role: Provide input on how to structure and model the data to uncover insights and offer fresh perspectives on sustainability.

Who we are looking for:
- Business & analytical mindset: You understand how to extract real business value from data and can suggest the right types of analyses and data manipulations.
- Technical expertise: Strong experience with Google Cloud Platform, particularly BigQuery and Looker.
- Sustainability knowledge (a plus): Experience with CO‚ÇÇ emissions data, environmental calculations, or sustainability-related analytics is highly valued.
- Communication skills: Ability to explain complex data insights in a clear and engaging way, both visually and in written documentation.

Key responsibilities:
- Review existing data structure and sources to ensure they are optimized for impactful insights in Looker.
- Set up LookML models and relationships that support meaningful analytics and storytelling.
- Design a dashboard that provides both high-level KPIs and granular drill-downs for further investigation.
- Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and adaptable, allowing for easy updates as new data becomes available.
- Suggest ways to improve data collection and structuring to enhance long-term analytical value.

How to apply:
Please provide:
- A short description of your experience with Looker, BigQuery, and Google Cloud.
- Examples of past dashboards or projects you‚Äôve built‚Äîideally where data was used to drive business decisions, not just for reporting.
- A brief outline of how you would approach this project (key steps and priorities).
- Estimated time requirements and your availability.

Timeline & scope:
- The project can start immediately.
- We aim to have a first working version within a few weeks but are flexible on exact timing.
- If this collaboration goes well, there‚Äôs potential for ongoing work.

Budget:
Please provide your hourly rate or a fixed price proposal. We are open to discussing based on your expertise and approach.

The migration will be performed in an ""As Is"" format, meaning a clean replication of the same queries from Synapse to Databricks, using the structure already created by one of our analysts, organized into notebooks and scheduled via workflows for daily loads.

Databricks was deployed in the PRJ-INGEST√ÉO-DE-DADOS-BI project, utilizing the shared network PRJ-HOST-NETWORK to align with security policies.

A cluster was created with a cost-effective configuration, ensuring optimization without compromising data ingestion pipeline processing capacity, along with the installation of the JDBC library.

The Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers were structured in Google Cloud Storage, ensuring organization, modularity, and scalability of the environment.

With the infrastructure set up, the project will move forward with implementing data ingestion pipelines while maintaining the logic, queries, and business rules from Azure.  

Additionally, the resource must clone the Power BI dashboards currently hosted in Microsoft's Azure cloud and upload them to the designated workspace for dashboards in GCP.

Once migrated, the data sources within the dashboards must be repointed to Databricks, ensuring that all dashboards function seamlessly with the new data infrastructure.

The goal of the project is to migrate all the pipelines and have cloned dashboards in perfect condition, identical to the production environment.

extracting data from the Bronze layer (tables such as *[REDACTED], *[REDACTED]*, and *[REDACTED]**, consolidated via UNION ALL);

type conversion and column creation (e.g., CD_ATENDIMENTO converted to DOUBLE, CD_SERVICO converted to DECIMAL (38,0), DS_TIP_MAR converted to STRING);

creation of surrogate keys to ensure uniqueness and traceability (such as SK_FATO_ATENDIMENTO, SK_FATO_PACIENTE, SK_ESPECIALID, SK_CONVENIO, SK_CID, SK_LEITOS, SK_ORI_ATE, and SK_PRESTADOR);

data enrichment by adding a DATA_CARGA column (formatted as dd/MM/yyyy);

column selection to include the created surrogate keys and relevant attributes;

saving transformed data in the Silver layer via saveTableFileSilver (""DIM_ATENDIMENTO"", df);

saving validated data in the Gold layer using saveTableFileGold (""lwd_dim_atendimento_01"", df);

and data visualization by loading a Parquet file for validation and display.  

This ETL process is designed to consolidate data from multiple sources into the Bronze layer, enrich it in the Silver layer, and make it available in the Gold layer for advanced analytics.

Databricks Workflows will be used to orchestrate task execution, allowing flexible automation and integration with other systems.

The detailed workflow functionality includes adding tasks, where each step represents a phase in the pipeline, ensuring an efficient automation process for data migration, transformation, and dashboard replication.",3,"['ETL Pipeline', 'Data Modeling', 'Databricks Platform', 'Database Design', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Microsoft Power BI Development']",20 to 50,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,,,10000.0,1,0,0,-inf

1. A cost-savings analysis showing how much my product saves people money by replacing in-home products.

Environmental Footprint Analysis
1. Analysis demonstrating the amount of plastic saved by individuals who invest in my machine who replace in-home products (Same list of products as above).
2. Analysis demonstrating the amount of plastic saved by individuals who invest in my machine who used to drink out of plastic water bottles and now do not.
3. Combined environmental stewardship analysis

Presentation of the data for customers as:
a) An easy to understand 1-pager guide (spreadsheet format) for my customers to understand the products this machine replaces and average monthly savings for a family of 4 (Mother, Father, Sister, Brother) so essentially some products are only going to be used by the Mother and Sister like make up remover, etc. using lower to middle class products (purchased from Walmart, Amazon, CVS, Rite Aid in the analysis to be as realistic as possible)
b) If possible, I would like a 1 pager visual demonstrating the environmental footprint saved by my device but if design is not in your wheelhouse, I'm more interested in the data analysis side of things for this project!

It has seven variables:
- ""AcquirorNameEikon"": The name of the acquirer firm (as presented on the Eikon database.
- ""ticker"": the stock symbol used to identify the firm (in this case, the acquirer);
- ""cusip8_comp"": an 8-digit code extracted from Compustat that uniquely identifies the firm (in this case, the Acquirer).
- ""event_date"": the date when the Merger or Acquisition was announced;
- ""TranscriptFile"": a file name of the corresponding announcement transcript (not important for this study).
- ""PrivateTarget"": a variable which takes the value 1 if the acquired firm (or Target) is Private and 0 if the acquired firm (or Target) is Public

The variables I need to collect for each observation/event are the following:
- Acquisition premium (only for the events in which the Target is Public (i.e., when PrivateTarget=0)
- Overall number of Mergers and Acquisitions in the US in the quarter of the announcement date (as specified in ""event_date"")
- Total number of board members of the Acquirer
- Total number of independent board members of the Acquirer
- Binary variable taking the value of 1 if the CEO is also the Chairman of the Board and 0 otherwise)
- Analyst coverage (i.e., count of sell-side analysts issuing earnings forecasts or recommendations for a firm)
- Analyst recommendations (i.e., number of 1 (Strong Buy), ..., and 5 (Strong Sell) from all analysts).

The freelancer will have to find a suitable database from which to extract the required variables (some possible options could be Eikon, SDC, Compustat, etc.) and explain the collection process. For each variable, a column should be added to the attached file with the values for that variable.

Perform data analysis and research and share findings. Use MS Excel, raw data files provided, online resources, and any other tools or resources at contractor's discretion, to identify instances where vendors are delivering similar services to and/or across 2 or more sub-organizations(known as bureaus) within the Department of Commerce(DOC).

The goal is to highlight evidence of such scenarios in a new Excel (.xlsx) output file and provide a summary of findings.

The purpose and business goal of this exercise is to enable the Department of Commerce to avoid duplicative costs via negotiation with vendors for a more competitive rate, or the removal of redundant contracts/services.

Objective Context/Background:

‚Ä¢ If the vendor ""Thundercat"" is providing AWS brokerage services to MBDA(bureau 1), but providing cyber-security services to EDA(bureau 2) - that's not a significant or value-added analytics finding.........because separate services doesn't present a lot of opportunity for consolidation or cost savings with that one vendor.
‚Ä¢ However, if that one/single vendor is providing the SAME exact product or service across 2 or more bureaus - then that's an analytical finding or outcome we want to document and point to in our discussions with our stakeholders

Tasks:
1. Review all data
2. Perform analysis to identify contract overlap across bureaus/organizations
3. Utilize external/public resources as needed to find out exactly which services/products were offered as part of contract
4. Try to realize the most granular levels of contract detail possible to ensure that 2/more bureaus are using the same exact product or service

Timeline:
1. Prefer to receive first draft of results/findings by end of Sunday (at 9PM EST U.S.)
2. This would allow for any updated iterations/revisions by 12Noon Monday (EST U.S.), based on review of Sunday's findings

Resources/Data:
1. DOC_FPDS_IT_Data_FY24_YTD_11142024 Excel - This file includes DOC data extracted from the PFDS system, and useful data inside this file includes, but is not limited to:
a. ""vendors by bureau"" tab
b. ""FPDS filtered for DOC"" tab
i. Column AP
ii. Column CH - ""master_piid""
iii. Column CN - ""naics_code""
iv. Column CO - ""naics_description""
v. Column CS - ""piid"" - this is a code that often times aligns with the ""Award ID"" that allows you to research more details about the product/services provided
vi. Column DD - ""product_or_service_description""
c. ""vendors with most bureaus"" tab

Data Modeling & Analysis: Using techniques such as regression, classification, or clustering to build models that can predict outcomes or classify data. The goal is to create actionable insights that guide decision-making.

Visualization: Creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to present findings in a clear, visual way. This helps stakeholders understand complex data and makes it easier for decision-makers to act on the information.

Reporting & Communication: Presenting insights and recommendations to management or other stakeholders. This often involves writing reports or giving presentations to explain the results of analyses.

Flask App Checklist for High Scalability (1000+ Users Concurrently)
1. Code Structure & Maintainability
(Flask is more lightweight than Django, so we need to structure it well to avoid a messy monolith.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask Blueprints for modularity (e.g., users/, billing/, credits/, api/).
‚úîÔ∏è Separate files for routes, models, authentication, and utilities (Flask doesn‚Äôt enforce structure like Django).
‚úîÔ∏è Follow Flask best practices: Use application factory pattern to allow flexible configurations.
‚úîÔ∏è Avoid monolithic code by keeping reusable functions in utils/ and moving business logic outside routes.
‚úîÔ∏è Decouple services where possible (e.g., separate worker processes for background tasks).
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents spaghetti code that slows down scaling efforts.
Ensures new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.

2. Database Optimization (PostgreSQL)
(Using SQLAlchemy ORM instead of Django‚Äôs ORM.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use SQLAlchemy ORM (or Flask-SQLAlchemy) for database interaction.
‚úîÔ∏è Manually create indexes (Index('index_name', Model.field)) since Flask doesn‚Äôt auto-index like Django.
‚úîÔ∏è Use SQLAlchemy connection pooling (pool_pre_ping=True, pool_size=20, max_overflow=0).
‚úîÔ∏è Implement Redis/Memcached caching (e.g., Flask-Caching).
‚úîÔ∏è Prevent N+1 query problems by using joinedload() in SQLAlchemy.
‚úîÔ∏è Read Replicas: Set up read replicas to distribute database read requests.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Optimized queries allow faster responses under high load.
Connection pooling prevents too many open database connections.
Redis caching reduces database calls, improving response times.

3. Multi-User Support (1000+ Concurrent Users)
(Flask handles sessions differently than Django.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask-Session to store session data in Redis instead of the database.
‚úîÔ∏è Generate unique session IDs and store them in Redis for fast lookups.
‚úîÔ∏è Use Celery + Redis for async tasks (e.g., processing outputs, deleting old data).
‚úîÔ∏è Paginate large dataset queries using Flask-SQLAlchemy‚Äôs pagination methods.
‚úîÔ∏è Rate limit requests per user/IP to prevent abuse and API overload.
‚úîÔ∏è Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple Flask instances behind a load balancer.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Redis prevents database session overload, making Flask faster under heavy load.
Load balancing distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers.
Rate limiting protects against DDoS attacks and server abuse.

4. AWS S3 Bucket (Input/Output Storage)
‚úîÔ∏è Store all user-generated content in S3 using boto3.
‚úîÔ∏è Use pre-signed URLs for secure file uploads/downloads.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement lifecycle policies for automatic old file deletion.
‚úîÔ∏è Restrict S3 permissions (ensure private access).
‚úîÔ∏è Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster file uploads/downloads globally.
‚úÖ How it helps:
No server storage needed, reducing system load.
Scalable storage solution that handles millions of files.
Faster access to files globally with S3 Transfer Acceleration.

5. Payments & Credit-Based System (Stripe)
‚úîÔ∏è Integrate Stripe API with Flask (stripe-python package).
‚úîÔ∏è Implement credit deduction logic only after successful processing.
‚úîÔ∏è Build a billing history table in PostgreSQL.
‚úîÔ∏è Admin panel for manual credit adjustments (use Flask-Admin or a custom dashboard).
‚úîÔ∏è Log failed payment attempts for debugging.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents fraudulent use of credits.
Ensures users get billed correctly even under high load.

6. Security & Protection
‚úîÔ∏è Enforce HTTPS and secure cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True).
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement rate limiting using Flask-Limiter.
‚úîÔ∏è Enable CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.
‚úîÔ∏è Store API keys & secrets in .env files using python-dotenv.
‚úîÔ∏è Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) for extra protection against attacks.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents API abuse with rate limits.
Protects against unauthorized access and session hijacking.

7. Deployment & Infrastructure (Auto-Scaling)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Gunicorn + Nginx for serving Flask in production.
‚úîÔ∏è Containerize with Docker (docker-compose.yml for easy deployment).
‚úîÔ∏è Enable auto-scaling with AWS ECS/Kubernetes/DigitalOcean Apps.
‚úîÔ∏è Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly.
‚úîÔ∏è Use health checks to detect and restart failing instances.
‚úÖ How it helps:
More instances launch automatically when traffic increases.
Load balancing ensures no single server gets overwhelmed.

8. Logging, Monitoring & Error Tracking
‚úîÔ∏è Use Sentry or Rollbar for real-time error tracking.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement logging for failed payments & user actions.
‚úîÔ∏è Monitor app performance using Prometheus + Grafana.
‚úîÔ∏è Set up alerts for high database usage or downtime.
‚úîÔ∏è Log Celery task failures for debugging async jobs.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Detects issues before they cause downtime.
Tracks high-usage areas to optimize performance.

9. Scheduled Cleanup Script (S3)

- actuary and employer can dispute and claim refunds

The Situation:

I‚Äôm using FlutterFlow to connect my app with an API (using API Flow). The setup is mostly done‚ÄîI‚Äôve connected the API, and it seems to be communicating fine. But here‚Äôs the issue:

The Problem:

While the API call is successfully triggered, the data isn‚Äôt showing up on the UI as expected. ü§î
I‚Äôve confirmed the API connection and set up the data flow, but FlutterFlow‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt seem to fetch or display the data correctly.

What I‚Äôve Tried:
1. Checked API connection settings: API key and URL seem fine.
2. Used dynamic data sources in FlutterFlow to bind API data to the UI.

What‚Äôs Next:

I‚Äôm thinking of bringing in a FlutterFlow expert to help me with:
1. Fixing the data-binding issue between the API response and the UI.
2. Ensuring the API call is properly mapped to the fields that need to display the data.
3. Debugging any potential CORS or data handling problems that might be causing the issue.

This dashboard would be giving real time trade performance information for every strategy, and there would be a ranking leaderboard for the most profitable strategies the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Besides the main dashboard itself, each strategy would need to be able to be clicked on to view more detailed strategy performance of each strategy. A user would then have the option to copy that strategy and automate it in a simple copy bot format.

Key requirements:

- We do not know how to integrate the backtest and live forward test performance metrics from TradingView, whether that be through API, webhooks, or web scraping - but we would want a developer that could figure that out.

- Admin Panel to add/edit/or remove TradingView strategies.
- Admin Panel to add/edit/ or remove users to use the dashboard platform.
- User Favorites page where users can view the strategies they have favorited from the dashboard. (only if we don't do phase 2)

TradingView Integrations
‚Ä¢ Connect to TradingView backtesting data through API, webhooks, web scraping or however possible. (for live data, strategy tracking) Would need the developer to find the best solution for this.

PHASE 2 WOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

Incorporating a Trading Bot (Copy Bot) into the strategy performance tracking dashboard.
Users would be able to select a strategy to automate and copy the signals from.
Would want the following exchanges broker included - Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, Robinhood, Tradovate, Tradestation, MetaTrader, Interactive Brokers.

- Creating the bot dashboard (simple, easy to use system for users)
- Connecting Exchanges/Brokers panel.
- Trade History panel

I‚Äôm facing an issue with Flask session persistence after the OAuth login flow with Google. When the user logs in and is redirected back to my site, a new session is created, causing the app to lose stored credentials.

Issue Details:
- The Flask app is storing Google OAuth credentials in the session (session[""google_credentials""]).
- After the OAuth login redirect (/google/callback), the session is lost and a new session file is created in the flask_session folder.
- Debugging confirms:
   - Cookies are enabled and being set in the browser.
   - Session data exists before redirect but disappears after.
session.keys() only shows [""_permanent""] after the redirect.
- I have tried setting:
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = ""None""
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   - SESSION_TYPE = ""filesystem""
- Issue persists despite these fixes.

Project Details:
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Auth Flow: Google OAuth 2.0
- Session Management: Flask-Session (filesystem-based)
- Hosting: Local development for now (planning for deployment)

Deliverables:
- Diagnose and fix the session persistence issue.
- Ensure session[""google_credentials""] is retained after the redirect.
- Provide a clear explanation of the fix so I can implement it in the future.
- Verify Google Calendar API authentication works properly.

Ideal Candidate:
- Flask + OAuth 2.0 expertise (especially Google OAuth)
- Strong understanding of Flask-Session and cookie behavior
- Experience debugging session persistence issues
- Familiarity with React + Flask integrations (bonus)
- Clear communicator who can explain the fix

We are looking for an experienced developer to build a document scanning and editing feature within our SaaS-based fleet management platform. This feature will enable fleet managers to upload, scan, and edit work orders, invoices, and maintenance records with high accuracy and efficiency. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface where users can click on the document to highlight corresponding fields in the form, and vice versa (similar to Nanonets).
The front-end should align with the UX/UI standards of modern SaaS applications, ensuring a seamless, structured workflow for processing scanned work orders. The system should handle large document sets efficiently, validate extracted data, and provide a guided review process for error correction.

https://app.nanonets.com/ is a great example app that does this well. Here is a video showing it:
https://www.loom.com/share/f5aa28ec26e54da49e9ea191f4b1b904

Technical Scope
Document Upload & Processing
File Upload UI:
Drag-and-drop and direct file selection.
Show a real-time progress bar during upload.
Validate file formats and display a preview before submission.
OCR & Data Extraction:
Extract key fields from work orders, invoices, and maintenance logs (e.g., date, vendor, part details, labor costs, total amounts).
Implement error handling and detailed feedback for missing or incorrectly parsed fields.

Interactive Editing & Validation
Two-way document interaction:
Clicking a field in the document highlights the corresponding field in the form, and vice versa.
Allow inline editing of all extracted values.
Editable fields include cost, quantity, unit price, markup, and descriptions.
Bounding Box Coordination:
Each extracted field is visually outlined in the document with a bounding box.
When a user selects a field in the form, the corresponding bounding box in the document is highlighted for better visibility.
Users can drag and resize bounding boxes to correct OCR misalignment if needed.
Implement real-time field linking where adjustments in the bounding box automatically update the extracted value in the form.
Ensure bounding boxes adapt dynamically for multi-page documents and various font styles.
Guided Validation & Review:
Introduce a step-by-step verification process with collapsible sections for labor, parts, and total costs.
Users must check off each section before submitting.
Error-checking bubbles should provide inline hints for verification.
Zoom & Navigation Improvements:
A hand tool should allow smooth movement inside the zoomed document (instead of using scroll bars).
Ensure smooth scrolling behavior where the left panel (document preview) remains fixed, while the right panel (form) scrolls independently.

Expected Deliverables
‚úÖ Fully functional document scanning & editing tool integrated into the fleet management platform.
‚úÖ User-friendly UI/UX for uploading, validating, and editing scanned work orders.
‚úÖ Real-time interactive editing between scanned documents and form fields.
‚úÖ Optimized OCR pipeline that minimizes scan time while maintaining accuracy.
‚úÖ Guided walkthrough validation process with collapsible sections and inline hints.



Skills Required
üü¢ Frontend: React.js, Ant Design (preferred), modern UI frameworks.
üü¢ Backend: Node.js, Python (for OCR/AI processing), SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
üü¢ File Processing: PDF/image parsing, error handling, validation

Project Milestones & Timeline

- **Minimize HTTP requests** and optimize the **critical rendering path**.  
- Address **long main-thread tasks** and **avoid chaining critical requests**.  
- Serve **static assets with an efficient cache policy** (29 resources identified).

It does everything I need it to do like captions / subtitles, etc.

I now want to add a feature that ingests a long video (assume 1 hour) and identifies the viral %10% best clips and cuts them into short vids for Tiktok, Reels, YT Shorts, etc.

Therefore, the logic must be SMART enough to figure out which parts of the long video are worth cutting.

** IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO WORK WITH. **

We obviously use:
- NodeJS / Next JS
- FFmpeg
- Remotion
- OpenAI or other AI LLM to do the identification and cutting.

** IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO WORK WITH. **

REQUIREMENTS:
----
1) DELIVERABLE - You present me with working flow. You get paid and a great review.

2) SOLUTION & COST PER VIDEO PROCESSED (cost per video rendering) - the solution must be cheap to create a video -- obviously if it costs $5 to cut a single video, it's NOT marketable. I'm looking for a solution that can get such videos renderered in cents.

3) SMART SELECTION OF CLIPS & CUTTING - the clips chosen by the AI must make sense and be the best clips of the video. Obviously. we can't be perfect all the time but you shouldn't have basic issues like cutting off the voice mid-sentence, choosing completely irrelevant clips, etc.

4) TECH STACK - Must use our tech stack as this feature will be bolted on to an existing app that is built on NodeJS (back-end), NextJS (frontend), MongoDB (database), and Redis for caching. We already use FFmpeg which you will need.

5) TIMELINE - Want this done within 2 weeks or less.

6) COMMENTED CODE - well structured, clean, commented code so that my dev can easily bolt it on to my app.

Current setup: We have a WordPress website with booking functionality built using Guesty's Open API. The code is currently located in the WordPress theme editor.

Existing features: The site displays a search box, listings, and booking options.

Problem: We've realized that we need to add filters to our listings and change from a base price to a calendar-based pricing system. Unfortunately, the Open API isn't ideal for these requirements.

Your task: You'll need to convert our existing code to work with the BE-API. This involves:

Setting up a new BE-API instance

Rewriting our API calls to use BE-API endpoints

Implementing new filtering functionality

Updating the pricing display to show calendar-based prices

Challenges: This transition will require significant changes to the existing codebase. You'll need to familiarize yourself with both the current implementation and the BE-API documentation.

The main goal is to help users (primarily students) create and study flashcards, summaries, and quizzes, with the option to generate them automatically from uploaded PDFs, images, or text.

Below is an overview of the functionality I‚Äôd like implemented:
1. User Registration and Profiles
Sign Up / Log In: Standard email/password or social logins.
Profile Settings: Basic information, notification preferences, and language settings.

2. Flashcard Creation & Management
Manual Creation: Users can manually add flashcards (front/back or question/answer) with formatting (bold, italics, etc.).
Automated Generation: Users can upload a file or paste text, and the app should parse it to identify key concepts. Automatically create flashcards from that content (similar to mindgrasp.ai or Vaia).

3. Flashcard Library
Organized Sets: Users can group flashcards into themed sets or subjects (like Quizlet).
Search & Filter: By title, subject, difficulty, or date created.
Share Options (optional, if time permits): Let users share sets with friends or make them public.

4. Study & Quiz Features
Flip-Based Study: Show front side first, then reveal the answer on the back (like traditional flashcards).
Difficulty/Confidence Rating: After viewing an answer, user labels how easy or hard it was. This data can feed a spaced repetition algorithm so that harder cards appear more frequently.
Progress Tracking: Display how many cards are left, correct/incorrect counts, or a progress bar.
Multiple Question Types (optional): If possible, beyond just ‚Äúflip cards,‚Äù we might introduce multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

5. AI/Spaced Repetition Integration
Adaptive Scheduling: Cards rated ‚Äúhard‚Äù appear more often than easier ones (similar to Anki).
Summaries & Key Concepts: If possible, incorporate an AI summarizer that condenses large pieces of text into bullet points or potential Q&A pairs.

6. User Experience & Interface
Clean, Intuitive UI: Reference Quizlet‚Äôs minimal approach.
Visual Cues: Simple icons for flipping cards, rating difficulty, or uploading documents (similar to Vaia‚Äôs design style).
Responsive Design: Should work smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.


7. Additional Features (Nice to Have)
Achievements/Analytics: Show stats like how many cards studied, average success rate, or daily streaks to motivate learning.

It will provide tools for uploading cruise sheets (forestry measurement data), calculating various timber volume metrics (calculations provided), and visualizing forest composition with basic graphs.

-Core Capabilities-

Property and Stand Management

Create and manage multiple forest properties
Organize forests into logical ""stands"" (management units)
Track data by geographic region to apply appropriate regional conversion factors
Delete properties and stands when no longer needed


Data Import and Processing

Upload Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) timber cruise sheets
Process raw data into standardized metrics
Store data in a structured database for analysis


Volume Calculations

Calculate key forestry metrics from basal area measurements:

Basal area per acre (ft¬≤)
Stems per acre
Cords per acre
Cubic feet per acre
Tons per acre
MBF (thousand board feet) per acre




Region-Specific Calculations

Apply different conversion factors (provided) for various US regions:

Northeast
Southeast
Midwest
West
Pacific Northwest


Account for regional differences in tree growth patterns and measurement standards


Species-Specific Factors

Apply species-specific modifiers (provided) to account for differences in:

Wood density
Tree form
Growth patterns

Support for numerous tree species including:

Softwoods (Red Spruce, White Pine, Balsam Fir, etc.)
Hardwoods (Oak, Maple, Birch, etc.)


Visualization Tools

Generate charts and graphs including:

Species composition pie charts
Volume distribution bar charts


Display summary statistics in tabular format
Compare data across stands and properties


Data Export

Export data to PDF for reports and documentation
Print capability as a fallback for PDF generation


User Access Control

User-specific data management (each user can only see their own properties)


Administration Features

Shortcode integration ([forest_inventory]) for embedding the tool on any page


Technical Implementation
The plugin follows WordPress plugin architecture best practices:

Separate admin and public-facing components
Database tables for properties, stands, and inventory data
AJAX-based data processing for a responsive user experience
Integration with Chart.js for data visualization
Dependency management for required libraries (PhpSpreadsheet for Excel processing)
Internationalization support

Data Processing Methodology
The plugin employs a sophisticated two-factor approach to calculate timber volumes:

Regional base factors specific to different parts of the country
Species-specific modifiers that account for differences in wood properties

This approach provides more accurate volume estimates than a one-size-fits-all calculation method and allows for professional-grade timber inventory management directly within WordPress.
User Interface
The interface is divided into four main tabs:

Properties - View and manage existing properties and stands
Create Property - Add new forest properties to the system
Add Stand - Upload cruise data for a specific stand within a property
Data View - Visualize and analyze inventory data with charts and tables

Overall, this plugin will provide comprehensive forest inventory management capabilities for woodland owners, foresters, and timber management professionals in a user-friendly WordPress interface.

However, due to Lovable.dev‚Äôs limitations on collaboration, I‚Äôd like to work closely with someone throughout the process rather than just handing over the project.

This means I‚Äôm looking for someone who can not only help implement solutions but also guide me along the way, explaining what‚Äôs happening and how I can make better technical decisions in the future. I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúdone-for-you‚Äù approach‚ÄîI want to understand the changes being made and what I could do differently next time.

Project Overview:

I‚Äôve built an app that enables quick, on-the-fly proposal creation during sales calls. These proposals can be updated post-call, shared via live links, and compared side-by-side. However, I need help solving a few major challenges:

Key Challenges to Solve:
1. Optimize Shared Results Load Time
‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúShared Results‚Äù page, which displays past proposals, takes too long to load (sometimes over 1.5 minutes).
‚Ä¢ It includes details such as proposal creator, assignee, attendees, creation date, status (draft/published), and actions (edit, delete, copy, view).
‚Ä¢ I need improvements in query efficiency and performance to make this load faster.
2. Fix OpenAI Integration for Proposal Summaries
‚Ä¢ The proposal editor includes a ‚ÄúGenerate Summary‚Äù feature that should extract key details from a transcript via OpenAI.
‚Ä¢ The summary sections include:
‚Ä¢ Introduction
‚Ä¢ Solution Overview
‚Ä¢ Current Situation
‚Ä¢ Future Goals
‚Ä¢ Challenges
‚Ä¢ Currently, generating summaries fails with the error: ‚ÄúAnalysis error. Failed to send a request to the edge function.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ I need help diagnosing whether this is an issue with my Supabase edge function or the OpenAI API request.
3. Potential Expansion: AI Demo System
‚Ä¢ I have a table containing URLs for live AI demos that simulate real-world AI chat experiences.
‚Ä¢ I want to create a searchable demo experience where users can select an industry and test AI interactions relevant to their needs.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm unsure whether this should be a separate project or an extension of my current system. I‚Äôd love input on the best approach.

Ideal Skills & Experience:
‚Ä¢ Supabase: Experience optimizing queries and edge functions.
‚Ä¢ OpenAI API: Familiarity with integrating AI-driven text generation.
‚Ä¢ Full-Stack Development: Strong background in backend optimization and UI performance.
‚Ä¢ Database Performance Optimization: Ability to debug slow-loading pages and speed up data retrieval.
‚Ä¢ Mentorship & Collaboration: Willingness to walk me through the process, answer questions, and explain decisions.
‚Ä¢ Experience with AI Demos (Optional): If you have experience building interactive AI showcases, that‚Äôs a bonus.

Next Steps:

If this sounds like a project you can help with, please include:
‚Ä¢ A brief explanation of how you would approach fixing the slow-loading shared results page.
‚Ä¢ Your experience with Supabase edge functions and OpenAI API integrations.
‚Ä¢ Any thoughts on whether the AI demo system should be a separate project or an extension of the current app.
‚Ä¢ Your experience with mentoring or coaching developers through technical challenges.
