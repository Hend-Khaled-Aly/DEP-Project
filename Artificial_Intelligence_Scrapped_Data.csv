This system ingests and learns from:
• Company knowledge base (documents, PDFs in Google Drive)
• Client/supplier/staff communications (emails, messages, calls, meeting transcripts)
• Human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms
• Historical interactions and their outcomes

Currently, we have a prototype built with n8n and Supabase but are facing challenges with hallucinations and need to enhance response accuracy while personalizing communication style based on the user.


Primary Focus
We need to optimize our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to:
•Deliver consistently accurate, factual responses from our knowledge base
• Adjust tone, formality, and technical depth based on user relationship level
• Scale efficiently as our data grows to potentially millions of entries
• Implement true learning mechanisms that improve performance over time


Learning Capabilities (Critical)
We're not just looking for a static RAG system. We want a solution that:
• Remembers past interactions and incorporates that context into future responses
• Learns from human corrections when hallucinations occur
• Improves retrieval accuracy based on which documents were actually helpful
• Adapts to changing information as our business knowledge evolves
• Refines its communication style based on successful interactions
• Builds relationship memory with specific contacts and their preferences


Technical Requirements
• Proven expertise implementing RAG systems at scale (100K+ documents)
• Deep knowledge of advanced chunking strategies, metadata optimization, and embedding techniques
• Experience with vector database optimization (we currently use Supabase, but open to alternatives)
• Strong understanding of prompt engineering for accurate information retrieval
• Ability to implement user/context-aware response formatting
• Experience building systems with feedback loops and continuous learning
• Knowledge of implementing memory in AI systems (conversation history, interaction patterns)


Current System
• n8n workflows for data processing and integration
• Supabase for vector storage
• Multi-step query processing with subquery breakdown
• HITL mechanisms for knowledge gaps


Ideal Candidate
• Has shipped production RAG systems handling large document collections
• Can demonstrate solutions to common hallucination problems
• Has implemented AI systems that demonstrably improve with usage
• Experience with workflow orchestration tools (n8n or similar)
• Strong communication skills to explain complex concepts

Future Opportunities
This project is foundational for our broader AI strategy. Success could lead to ongoing work developing specialized AI agents for different business functions.


Application Process
Please share:
• Examples of RAG systems you've built that handle similar scale challenges
• Your approach to reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy
• Specific examples of AI systems you've built that learned and improved over time
• How you'd implement a system that personalizes responses based on user context
• Experience scaling vector databases and optimizing retrieval performance

We're committed to building an effective, reliable system that gets better with each interaction and need a partner who can help us achieve this vision.

The main goal is to help users (primarily students) create and study flashcards, summaries, and quizzes, with the option to generate them automatically from uploaded PDFs, images, or text.

Below is an overview of the functionality I’d like implemented:
1. User Registration and Profiles
Sign Up / Log In: Standard email/password or social logins.
Profile Settings: Basic information, notification preferences, and language settings.

2. Flashcard Creation & Management
Manual Creation: Users can manually add flashcards (front/back or question/answer) with formatting (bold, italics, etc.).
Automated Generation: Users can upload a file or paste text, and the app should parse it to identify key concepts. Automatically create flashcards from that content (similar to mindgrasp.ai or Vaia).

3. Flashcard Library
Organized Sets: Users can group flashcards into themed sets or subjects (like Quizlet).
Search & Filter: By title, subject, difficulty, or date created.
Share Options (optional, if time permits): Let users share sets with friends or make them public.

4. Study & Quiz Features
Flip-Based Study: Show front side first, then reveal the answer on the back (like traditional flashcards).
Difficulty/Confidence Rating: After viewing an answer, user labels how easy or hard it was. This data can feed a spaced repetition algorithm so that harder cards appear more frequently.
Progress Tracking: Display how many cards are left, correct/incorrect counts, or a progress bar.
Multiple Question Types (optional): If possible, beyond just “flip cards,” we might introduce multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

5. AI/Spaced Repetition Integration
Adaptive Scheduling: Cards rated “hard” appear more often than easier ones (similar to Anki).
Summaries & Key Concepts: If possible, incorporate an AI summarizer that condenses large pieces of text into bullet points or potential Q&A pairs.

6. User Experience & Interface
Clean, Intuitive UI: Reference Quizlet’s minimal approach.
Visual Cues: Simple icons for flipping cards, rating difficulty, or uploading documents (similar to Vaia’s design style).
Responsive Design: Should work smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.


7. Additional Features (Nice to Have)
Achievements/Analytics: Show stats like how many cards studied, average success rate, or daily streaks to motivate learning.

However, due to Lovable.dev’s limitations on collaboration, I’d like to work closely with someone throughout the process rather than just handing over the project.

This means I’m looking for someone who can not only help implement solutions but also guide me along the way, explaining what’s happening and how I can make better technical decisions in the future. I don’t want a “done-for-you” approach—I want to understand the changes being made and what I could do differently next time.

Project Overview:

I’ve built an app that enables quick, on-the-fly proposal creation during sales calls. These proposals can be updated post-call, shared via live links, and compared side-by-side. However, I need help solving a few major challenges:

Key Challenges to Solve:
1. Optimize Shared Results Load Time
• The “Shared Results” page, which displays past proposals, takes too long to load (sometimes over 1.5 minutes).
• It includes details such as proposal creator, assignee, attendees, creation date, status (draft/published), and actions (edit, delete, copy, view).
• I need improvements in query efficiency and performance to make this load faster.
2. Fix OpenAI Integration for Proposal Summaries
• The proposal editor includes a “Generate Summary” feature that should extract key details from a transcript via OpenAI.
• The summary sections include:
• Introduction
• Solution Overview
• Current Situation
• Future Goals
• Challenges
• Currently, generating summaries fails with the error: “Analysis error. Failed to send a request to the edge function.”
• I need help diagnosing whether this is an issue with my Supabase edge function or the OpenAI API request.
3. Potential Expansion: AI Demo System
• I have a table containing URLs for live AI demos that simulate real-world AI chat experiences.
• I want to create a searchable demo experience where users can select an industry and test AI interactions relevant to their needs.
• I’m unsure whether this should be a separate project or an extension of my current system. I’d love input on the best approach.

Ideal Skills & Experience:
• Supabase: Experience optimizing queries and edge functions.
• OpenAI API: Familiarity with integrating AI-driven text generation.
• Full-Stack Development: Strong background in backend optimization and UI performance.
• Database Performance Optimization: Ability to debug slow-loading pages and speed up data retrieval.
• Mentorship & Collaboration: Willingness to walk me through the process, answer questions, and explain decisions.
• Experience with AI Demos (Optional): If you have experience building interactive AI showcases, that’s a bonus.

Next Steps:

If this sounds like a project you can help with, please include:
• A brief explanation of how you would approach fixing the slow-loading shared results page.
• Your experience with Supabase edge functions and OpenAI API integrations.
• Any thoughts on whether the AI demo system should be a separate project or an extension of the current app.
• Your experience with mentoring or coaching developers through technical challenges.

I’m excited to work with someone who can not only optimize and scale this tool but also help me grow my own technical understanding along the way! 🚀",$15.00,$80.00,"['$15.00', '$80.00']",Intermediate,"['OpenAI API', 'Web Development', 'Web Design', 'Full-Stack Development', 'React', 'PHP', 'Database Performance Optimization', 'UX & UI Design', 'Chart.js', 'JavaScript', 'Supabase', 'WordPress', 'Web Application']",1-3 months,Less than 30 hrs/week,20 to 50,1,1,0,$50,United States,2,2

We are an outplacement service provider helping job seekers land their next opportunity faster. We are building a private AI-powered portal (WordPress-based) where our candidates can access AI-driven tools to enhance their job search.

We already have:
✅ An AI-powered Cover Letter Generator with a working frontend.
✅ A frontend developer on our team who will assist in building the UI, though we value your experience in guiding best practices.
✅ A ChatGPT API account, which we plan to use for AI-generated content.

We now need an experienced WordPress developer with strong AI/API integration expertise to help us finalize and expand the portal.

Scope of Work:
🔹 Support the frontend integration – We have a frontend developer but appreciate UX/UI guidance.
🔹 Ensure seamless AI integration – Using OpenAI’s ChatGPT API (we already have an account).
🔹 Set up a secured WordPress portal – This is a private page for candidates, protected with a general password (no user registration).
🔹 Create a dashboard – A simple and elegant UI with navigation to different AI tools.
🔹 Implement four additional AI-powered tools (see below).
🔹 Integrate a third-party Resume Review API (like Resume Worded or Rezi) into the platform.

Each tool should generate instant results on the page, with an optional download button for users to save their output. If real-time API display isn’t possible for the Resume Review tool, an email-based response is fine.

AI-Powered Tools to Implement:
1️⃣ AI Interview Question Generator

Users paste a job description and their resume.
AI generates likely interview questions based on the job role.
2️⃣ AI Salary Negotiation & Offer Review

Users input their job offer details.
AI suggests counteroffers and negotiation strategies based on industry benchmarks.
3️⃣ AI Exit Statement & Career Gap Explanation

Users describe why they left their last job or career gap.
AI generates a polished, professional exit statement.
4️⃣ AI Resume Review & Optimization (Third-Party API Integration)

We will subscribe to an existing SaaS tool (e.g., Rezi, Resume Worded, or similar).
Freelancer will integrate the API into our website, ensuring it fits seamlessly within our brand.
If real-time API display isn’t possible, results can be sent via email.
Freelancer will research & recommend the best SaaS solution based on integration capabilities.
Technical Requirements:
✔ WordPress Development – Experience building secure, functional, and user-friendly portals.
✔ OpenAI API / GPT-4 Integration – Ability to implement AI-generated responses using our ChatGPT API account.
✔ Backend Development (PHP, MySQL, Python/Node.js for API handling) – To process AI requests efficiently.
✔ API Integration & SaaS Connectivity – Ability to integrate third-party services (Resume Review).
✔ Secure Access – Implement a general password for all users.
✔ UX/UI Design Guidance – We provide design guidelines and a frontend developer, but we expect expertise in structuring clean dashboards.
✔ Fast Turnaround – Target 6 weeks for completion.
✔ Post-Launch Support – Paid hourly, with bug fixes resolved within 48 hours.

Ideal Candidate:
🎯 Has built AI-powered job search tools before (resume analyzers, interview prep tools, etc.).

Strong Python skills for both AI workflows and lightweight data engineering tasks (basic ETL or data prep).
Prior experience working in healthcare or medicine — ideally familiarity with clinical workflows, patient consultations, and healthcare data compliance requirements.
Strong business acumen — able to not only build AI solutions, but shape them based on executive-level conversations and a deep understanding of business needs.
Bonus: Experience integrating LLMs into medical workflows — including patient intake, risk analysis, and treatment recommendations.
Excellent communication skills — comfortable working directly with C-suite leaders and translating complex AI concepts into clear, actionable steps.
Ability to self-manage, prioritize based on business value, and thrive in a fractional role with high flexibility.

This will require full time work, prioritized to this project until completion.

The project: Clients.ai – an AI-powered marketing automation platform that handles outreach, follow-ups, and client management. It’s almost there, but key features need to be finished, optimized, and refined.

If you’ve built React (JSX/TSX) + Node.js (Express) + PostgreSQL applications before, you’ll understand what needs to be done.

What’s on Your Desk?
The Frontend: Built in React (JSX/TSX) with Tailwind. The foundation is solid. The UI is mostly complete. What’s missing?

UI Consistency & Small Fixes: Standardize margins, fonts, and button placements across key pages (login, signup, dashboard). Minor copy edits for clarity and professionalism. Add missing headers, footers, and functional buttons/links.

Payment & Subscription Automation: Implement Stripe’s 18-day trial, automate free-year access for webinar buyers, and refine billing management (subscription control, conversion core purchases, and billing history).

Campaign & Dashboard Stability: Ensure campaigns track leads correctly, allow full editing (name, offer details, testimonials, etc.), and integrate seamless opt-in form generation. Fix dashboard inconsistencies in stats, campaign status updates, and active lead counts.

Email & API Integration: Improve email templates for clarity and branding. Ensure users can send emails via their own SMTP without external branding. Implement API integrations for seamless CRM sync.

Performance & UX Enhancements: Speed up form submissions, ensure real-time text generation works properly, improve animations for AI-driven data collection, and fix any broken UI/UX elements for a smooth, intuitive experience.

(I will provide a complete list after you have been vetted.

The Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL. It works, but some queries need optimization, API responses need to be snappier, and real-time communication could be improved.
The Database: PostgreSQL. The schema is in place. Some queries need performance tuning.


Finish the Members Area: It’s functional, but some logic is incomplete. UI interactions need final touches. Personalization features need polish.

Optimize Backend Performance: Some API calls are slower than they should be. Some queries are doing more work than necessary. You'll find the inefficiencies and clean them up.

Fix the “Little Things” That Make a Big Difference.

React (JSX/TSX) – If you don’t know JSX/TSX inside-out, this isn’t for you.
Node.js (Express) – You’ll be working with API endpoints and making them faster.
PostgreSQL – You need to be comfortable optimizing queries and database performance.
Tailwind CSS – The styling is mostly in place, but any UI fixes should be in line with it.
The Right Developer For This Job:
Sees the Whole Picture – You’re not just writing code. You understand how data should flow between the frontend and backend.
Fixes First, Optimizes Second – First, get everything working as it should. Then, make it faster.
Understands Real-Time Data Handling – We’re fetching updates dynamically, without the user noticing. You need to make that work seamlessly.
Works Without Hand-Holding – You’ll get access to the repo, the existing code, and a list of the known issues. Beyond that, you’ll need to figure things out and make decisions.

The Wrong Developer for This Job:
If you need someone to tell you exactly what to do next, you’ll struggle here.
If you build things that work “most of the time” but not always, that won’t cut it.
If you write code that works but is hard to maintain, this isn’t the place for you.

What You Need to Answer When Applying
💡 Tell us about a SaaS or dashboard project you’ve built with React & Node.js.
💡 Show us your GitHub, past work, or relevant examples (no generic resumes).
💡 Estimate how long this will take you to complete.

Budget & Timeline
💰 Budget: Open—depends on experience and how fast you can deliver

The MVP must be built fast (Beta tested and ready by July 1) and leveraging no-code/low-code and automation solutions where possible (e.g., Bubble.io, Frontly.ai, N8N, Make.com) to keep it flexible for future updates. AI automation should be simple and practical (e.g., historical sales insights using OpenAI).

📌 Key Responsibilities:

- Develop the MVP from scratch using no-code/low-code tools (preferred) or a simple backend/frontend solution.

- Implement a Retail Growth Score ranking system (A+ to C) for suppliers based on retailer sell-in/sell-out data.

- Create an AI-powered sell-in growth plan generator (basic AI-driven recommendations based on historical data).

- Enable CSV file uploads for supplier data input (no complex integrations in MVP).

- Build a simple supplier/retailer admin dashboard with live tracking.

- Automate email follow-ups and campaign activation using a one-click system.

- Ensure the system is secure (GDPR-compliant) and hosted in a scalable environment (AWS, Google Cloud, or other recommendation).

- Optimize for multilingual support (English-first, but suppliers should be able to send campaign proposals in Danish, etc.).

🔹 Ideal Developer Profile:

- Experienced with no-code/low-code platforms (Bubble.io, Frontly.ai, Make.com, N8N) or able to suggest a simple, scalable tech stack.

- Comfortable with AI-powered automation (e.g., OpenAI API, basic ML-based forecasting).

- Strong UX/UI skills to create a clean, intuitive dashboard.

- Ability to think smartly and avoid overcomplicating development.

- Familiar with Google Sheets, CSV data handling, and lightweight database management.

- Experience in building SaaS MVPs that scale.

📌 Timeline & Budget:

- MVP Beta (Basic Features): Ready by July 1 (aligns with 120-day consulting plan with first suppliers).

- MVP Full Launch: Within 3 months.

- Budget: $5,000 - $10,000 for MVP (developer should prioritize efficiency over custom-built complexity).

🔹 Next Steps:

If you’re interested, please include:

- Your experience with no-code/low-code tools or recommended tech stack.

- Examples of past SaaS or AI-powered automation projects.

- Estimated time & cost for MVP based on the scope above.

- Your approach to keeping development simple & scalable.

my name is Louis and I'm the co-founder of Uzai.
We've designed a SaaS platform enabling brand owners to centralize, analyze and store their proofs of use. This solution is based on the intensive use of artificial intelligence, from LLM models to image recognition.

In April/May, we'll be launching the commercial roll-out of this solution, in a distribution partnership with one of the major players in intellectual property management solutions. We already have very good signals from a number of key account customers, and anticipate a rapid ramp-up.

As such, we're looking for a full-stack development type to reinforce our team in a “fixed-price” approach, for an estimated workload of around 2 days a week, over a period of around 2 months (potentially more). The idea is for the freelancer to join the existing team of founders in order to absorb the peak workload linked to this commercial roll-out. The current team is made up of 4 people, two IP professionals and two IT professionals (+12 years' experience each). The mission is fully remote, as the team is currently split between Malta, Lyon and Strasbourg.

The platform is currently fully functional and has been scaled up for massive production use. Among the tasks to be carried out, we anticipate
- Various functional evolutions in response to customer feedback
- Resolution of bugs that will inevitably come to light
- Possible additional tasks to scale the solution

It's difficult to predict the exact tasks at this stage, but we're looking for someone who can offer this availability to help us ensure this crucial first step for the company.

The technical stack is as follows:
- Front-end: Angular 16
- Back: Node TS
- Data processing: Python
- Hosting: MS Azure

We don't have any particular requirements in terms of the candidate's experience, but we will ask them to take one or two technical tests before formalizing the collaboration. The skills we're particularly looking for for this assignment concern the back and front ends, i.e. nodeTS and Angular. We can handle the Python/AI/infra part ourselves.

In addition to technical skills, the candidate must also have the following competencies:
- Fluency in English in a professional context
- Ability to communicate directly with the customer or his technical teams
- Ability to follow functional specifications

Requirements:

1. Inputs:

— Wallpaper Image: A seamless, tilable wallpaper.
— Room Image: A photo of a room with white or neutral-colored walls.

2. Automatic Wall Detection & Masking:

— The workflow must automatically detect and mask walls—no manual masking.
— It should handle complex details like plants with small leaves, furniture edges, and decor items, ensuring a clean and professional result.

3. Wallpaper Application – Exact Representation:

— The wallpaper must be applied exactly as provided, with no alterations in color, pattern, or texture.
— Ability to adjust the scale of the wallpaper pattern.

4. Realistic Merging & Shadows:

— The workflow must preserve original lighting and shadows to ensure a natural and realistic final image.
— Shadows, reflections, and room depth should remain intact, making the wallpaper look genuinely applied to the wall.


Additional Considerations:

— It should support high-resolution images + upscaling

— The workflow should work well across different room types, angles, and lighting conditions.

— If needed, an opacity or blending strength adjustment can be included to refine integration in difficult lighting.


I am attaching three images below:

— One example of a room that would be used as input.

— A wallpaper image to be applied.

— A screenshot of a trial from another developer—while the masking and shadows were great, the workflow modified the pattern, making it unusable for my needs.

Generative AI Portfolio assignment,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Generative-Portfolio-assignment_~021896558521410055888/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Fixed-price,Worldwide,"Task 1 :

Fine-tune LLM for Language Translation
This assignment will challenge your ability to fine-tune a large language model, evaluate
its performance, and use LLM to generate synthesized data for a specific task. It will also
demonstrate your ability to write effective prompts for the assigned task. Additionally, it
will test your research and design skills for the task.
Task Description
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to fine-tune a model to
enhance its performance for a specific task. Also, it will show how existing large language
models can be used in the data collection process to enhance relatively smaller models.
This will involve:
• Selecting an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning a model for language translation
• Choosing a small pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned within a free Google
Colab notebook (T4 GPU, 15 GB VRAM, 12.7 GB RAM).
• Designing the experimental setup and evaluation metrics.
• Crafting an effective prompt to generate synthetic data for dataset expansion.
Research Phase
In the research phase, you will do an investigation to select two things:
● A benchmark dataset [Dataset A] with pairs of inputs for the German - French
language translation. The dataset should contain at least 1,000 pairs. If it contains
more, randomly select 1,000 pairs.
● A relatively small model [Model A] -not less than 1B parameters in size- that
could be tuned on Colab notebook setup with any tuning approach you studied
during the lectures. The model must be a pre-trained general-purpose large
language model in the first step and not a language translation model or a model
with random weights.
Note: We are always here to help. If you have any question during this phase, do not
hesitate to ask.
Design Phase
During this phase, you will need to decide which approach of fine-tuning you will use
based on the size of your model and the available computation you have in the Colab
notebook setup. In addition, you will need to decide the suitable split ratio between the
training [Dataset A: Train] and testing [Dataset A: Test] datasets in your benchmark
dataset. You will also need to create a suitable prompt for querying a large model with at
least 32B parameters, such as Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, to generate synthetic
data for expanding your training dataset. Furthermore, you will need to decide on a
suitable evaluation metric to evaluate all model’s performance on the targeted task.
Implementation Phase
Use a Python Colab notebook with a T4 GPU (15 GB VRAM, 12.7 GB RAM) to implement
your solution, adding clear explanations in the notebook cells for easy understanding of
your code. For each result, provide the appropriate explanation:
1. 2. 3. 4. Load [Dataset A] and split it according to the designed ratio.
Load your chosen pre-trained model [Model A].
Evaluate [Model A] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
Fine-tune [Model A] on the training dataset [Dataset A: Train] to create [Model
B].
5. Evaluate [Model B] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
6. Use the designed prompt to generate a new synthesized dataset [Dataset B],
twice the size of the training set [Dataset A: Train], using the selected larger
model.
7. 8. 9. Fine-tune [Model A] on the synthesized dataset [Dataset B] to create [Model C].
Evaluate [Model C] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
Combine [Dataset A: Train] and [Dataset B], shuffle them with suitable seeds,
and create [Dataset C].
10. Fine-tune [Model A] on the combined dataset [Dataset C] to create [Model D].
11. Evaluate [Model D] on the test dataset [Dataset A: Test] using the chosen metric.
12. Plot the performance of all models using appropriate visualizations.
Stretch Goal (for up to 10 additional points):
● Pick the best model performance and design a simple interface to query it using
your favourite technology (Example: Streamlit).

AI-powered floor replacement tool,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/powered-floor-replacement-tool_~021896601437626462755/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Hourly,Worldwide,"Hi,

We’re looking for a Python and Machine Learning expert to build the core visualization engine for an AI-powered floor replacement tool—think along the lines of HomeDesigns.ai Floor Editor or Winstars.ai Flooring Designer. This gig is all about the backend visualization: take an uploaded room image, detect the floor, and swap it with a custom texture, keeping it lean and cost-effective on a server. No fancy frontend—just a simple Python UI for testing.

**Here’s what we need:

Core Task: Use Python and OpenCV to detect floors and replace them with a custom tiled image we provide.

AI Models: Leverage or fine-tune lightweight ML models (e.g., segmentation) for accurate floor detection—good enough to keep things clean and precise. TensorFlow or PyTorch are our go-tos.

Server Efficiency: Deploy it on a low-cost server (like a small AWS/GCP instance). We want a solid balance of speed and accuracy without racking up big server bills—efficiency is the name of the game.

Simple UI: Build a basic Python UI (e.g., Tkinter or a script) so we can upload an image, select a texture, and tweak it—specifically, resize and rotate the tile/texture to fit the room. Nothing flashy, just functional.

Success Looks Like: The final image has no (or barely any) artifacting—clean edges, no weird glitches. The texture’s perspective matches the room realistically, like it belongs there. Plus, we can adjust the tile/texture size and rotation for a perfect fit.

**What We’re Looking For:

Strong Python and OpenCV skills—floor detection and texture replacement should be second nature to you.

Experience with lightweight ML models (e.g., U-Net, MobileNet) that deliver accuracy without eating resources.

Know-how to deploy on a server and keep costs low—think CPU-friendly or minimal GPU, maybe some model optimization tricks like quantization.

Ability to whip up a simple Python GUI that lets us resize and rotate textures on the fly.

A practical approach to hit our success criteria—clean output, realistic perspective, and flexible textures—without overcomplicating things.

**Project Scope & Budget:

We would like to go with a Fixed-price job, aiming for a working prototype in 4 weeks. Type (exp) at the start of your proposal.
Please come up with your reasonable quotes.

This is just the visualization engine—no frontend needed.

The service has to be able to filter out pre-defined areas in a batch of images, apply pixelation or a cover image, then generate the censored images for batch download.

The service should be able to filter out:
- nudity (soft)
- nudity (explicit)
- minors
- license plates
- branding

Most important aspect is filtering nudity and minors at the 1st step.

The flow should work in the following way:

1. batch of photos uploaded, or fed into the system via an API
2. The AI detects if the images need filtering or not.
3. The images that need filtering are highlighted with the critical area that should be filtered
4. Possibility of manual intervention for the adjustment of the filterable area if the AI did not do a proper job.
5. Applying batch filtering once the preview is approved.
6. Generating the filtered images for batch or selective download
7. Feeding back the manual intervention area for training data for the AI so the model constantly improves as more and more images are filtered.

Filtering methods should be:
- pixelation
- blurring
- overlaying an image to the areas in question

Choosing the applied filtering method should be by the decision of the user.

Being a b2b tool, no fancy frontend is needed. The importance is the functionality of the flow and the results.

Step 2 once the project is finished for images is to repeat the process for videos.

- there will be 2 or 3 flows . One for replying. One for generating single posts. One for generating threads.
- Index expiry system (remove tweets older than X days for optimization). And regularly delete older data to save storage space.
- Use human-like delays between actions.
- integration with tg bots for control and monitor. And Manual pause/resume function for emergency shutdown.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in AWS and experience using Bedrock's LLM, along with TTS and STT technologies. Your expertise will help us create a seamless conversational agent that effectively engages users. Join us in pushing the boundaries of AI interaction!
Here's a high-level proof of concept (POC) for integrating your existing chatbot with AWS for data storage and retrieval:

*Architecture Overview*
1. User interacts with the chatbot through a frontend application (web or mobile or link sent as sms).
2. The chatbot uses AI  to understand user inputs and respond accordingly. The interface has LLM selection and voice selection but it will be removed, and my application will be used for settings.
3. User inputs are stored in an AWS database ( RDS).
4. The chatbot retrieves user data from the AWS database using a reference number if it is a previous client or gives a new reference number for a new client.
5. The chatbot integrates with a RAG and prompt system connected to the frontend application via settings.

*Technical Requirements*
1. *Chatbot Framework*: i already have full codes that is functional that uses LLM and voice selection but not refined and not integrated. So i need you to refine my existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services, you will work with my AWS team and they will help in integration as I already have other AI integrated.
2. *AWS Services*:
    - **: Store user data and conversation history, that will be my AWS team.
    
    - *API *: Handle incoming requests from the frontend application.
3. *Frontend Application*: Integrate with the chatbot using APIs and display chatbot responses.
4. *RAG and Prompt System*: Integrate with the frontend application and provide prompts to the user again I have the application team for that.

*Integration Steps*
1. *Refine Chatbot Code*: Update the existing chatbot code to integrate with AWS services.
2. *work with AWS team*.
3. *Integrate Chatbot with AWS*:
4. *Integrate Chatbot with Frontend Application*: Use APIs to integrate the chatbot with the frontend application for RAG, prompt, voice and llm selection.
5. *Test and Deploy*: Test the integrated system and deploy it to production.

*Reference Number Implementation*
1. *Generate Reference Number*: When a user starts the application, generate a unique reference number.
2. *Store Reference Number*: Store the reference number in the AWS database along with user data.
3. *Retrieve User Data*: When a user returns to the application, use the reference number to retrieve their user data from the AWS database.

*Multimodal Interaction (Text and Voice)*
1. *Text Input*: Handle text input from the user and respond with text and voice output.
2. *Voice Output*: Use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to generate voice output for user responses.

So I have a full built frontend application for conversation AI. That frontend has LLM and voice selection feature. That frontend is connected with my AWS rds. I just want to use what we currently have but want your expertise for the chatbot AI part of it

Build a conversation AI platform with RAG functionality using LlamaIndex and LangChain,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-conversation-platform-with-RAG-functionality-using-LlamaIndex-and-LangChain_~021895889090314257406/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Hourly,Worldwide,"The goal of the project is to build a conversation AI platform with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) backend system optimized for searching the content of Images, PDFs, Epub, Word, Excel, and other text-based documents containing images and tables. The system will provide two primary endpoints: one for document ingestion and another for querying documents. Additionally, a third endpoint will enable the user to call external LLMs (GPT-Mini) for handling queries beyond the RAG context.

In short, the user will be able to do the below:
1. Engage in a natural conversation with GPT-Mini (if no documents were uploaded)
2. Upload documents to a conversation (PDFs, images, text files, etc.)
3. Ask questions about the content of those documents


Overview of Key Components and Suggestions:

Document Ingestion & Extraction

Use Unstructured library to process diverse document formats (EPUB, Word, PDF, Excel)
Leverage PyPDF2, EbookLib to extract metadata (author, title, subject, creation date, page count)
Parse text, tables, and images while preserving their reference in the source document


Chunking

Implement paragraph-based chunking (~500 tokens maximum per chunk)
Preserve tables as individual chunks
Store images as separate chunks with contextual metadata


Embedding

Process English text/table chunks with GTE-Large model (1024-dimensional embeddings)
Process French text/table chunks with intfloat/multilingual-e5-large
Generate image chunk embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large


Storage

Store embeddings and metadata in Weaviate (HNSW Index)
Maintain additional metadata in PostgreSQL
Ensure consistent IDs across systems for efficient cross-referencing


Retrieval

Implement semantic/hybrid search through Weaviate for similarity-based retrieval
Apply re-ranking to top results using Cohere API for improved relevance
Return optimized results to the LLM for response generation


External LLM Integration

Design a new endpoint to handle queries outside RAG context
Implement API integration with both Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI (GPT) models
Create a query routing mechanism to determine when to use RAG vs. external LLMs
Develop a fallback system that uses external LLMs when RAG results are insufficient
Implement session management to maintain conversation context across different query types


Implementation Details

Use LlamaIndex for the data pipeline (ingestion to retrieval)
Employ LangChain for LLM interactions (both RAG-based and direct model calls)
Support streaming responses from both RAG and external LLM endpoints
Implement rate limiting and cost controls for external API calls
Create authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure API usage


API Endpoint Structure

/ingest: For document uploading and processing
/query: For RAG-based document queries
/chat: For handling conversations that might extend beyond document context
Optional /hybrid: An endpoint that automatically determines whether to use RAG or direct LLM calls



The system will allow users to upload up to 30 documents and ask questions about specific content within these materials. Users can query content from particular files, books, chapters, pages, images, or tables. When queries extend beyond the uploaded document context, the system will seamlessly transition to using Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's GPT models for comprehensive responses.
This implementation emphasizes LlamaIndex for the data pipeline and LangChain for LLM interaction, while allowing for flexibility in other components based on evolving requirements and performance considerations.",,,,Expert,"['RESTful API', 'Amazon Web Services', 'Docker', 'ABAP', 'API', 'Python', 'SAP', 'Generative AI', 'Golang']",1-3 months,Less than 30 hrs/week,5 to 10,7,9,2,$150,CAN,1,2

Job Summary

We are seeking a highly skilled Machine Learning Engineer to develop and deploy a self-supervised predictive ML model on AWS SageMaker that identifies the Top N products from an input CSV that are:
X
Y
Z

The model should be self-supervised, meaning it should automatically learn from new data without requiring manually labeled training samples. This approach will enable the system to continuously improve its predictions over time by identifying patterns from historical and incoming sales, pricing, and inventory data.

The ideal candidate should have expertise in self-supervised learning, time-series forecasting, feature learning, and AWS ML deployment.

Key Responsibilities
1. Self-Supervised Machine Learning Model Development

Design and implement a self-supervised ML model that detects products likely to sell out within 30-45 days, based on past trends and real-time data.
Develop an unsupervised feature learning mechanism that extracts patterns from sales velocity, price fluctuations, seasonality, and competition levels.
Implement contrastive learning, representation learning, and clustering-based techniques to enable the model to find patterns in unlabeled data.
Incorporate a profitability formula that factors in Amazon’s referral fees (15%), packaging/shipping costs ($7 per unit), and supplier shipping costs.
2. Data Engineering & Self-Supervised Feature Extraction

Automate feature learning from CSV files, Amazon APIs, and external data sources (e.g., Keepa, CamelCamelCamel).
Extract and process features such as moving averages, seasonality indicators, price elasticity, stock depletion rate, and competition density without human-labeled data.
Build a self-supervised training pipeline where the model continuously updates itself using historical and real-time data without manual intervention.
Store and manage structured datasets using AWS S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon DynamoDB.
3. AWS Deployment & Automated Model Training

Deploy the self-supervised ML model on AWS SageMaker, enabling automated inference and model updates.
Implement an AWS Lambda pipeline that triggers model retraining when new data is added.
Use SageMaker’s AutoML, serverless inference, and batch transformation for real-time and scheduled predictions.
Optimize the system for scalability using parallel data processing and distributed model training.
4. Model Evaluation & Continuous Learning

Monitor model performance using unsupervised evaluation metrics such as:
✅ Anomaly detection for unexpected trends
✅ Clustering consistency scores
✅ Self-labeling accuracy on inferred stockout risks
Retrain the model dynamically by feeding in new unlabeled data and allowing the system to refine predictions.
Implement AWS CloudWatch alerts to notify when the model confidence drops or anomalies are detected.
5. Intelligent Decision-Making & Business Impact

Generate automated reports ranking the Top N products that sellers should focus on.
Ensure that the model detects low-competition, high-margin products, giving sellers a competitive advantage.
Enable the business to automate restocking decisions, avoiding lost revenue due to stockouts and price misjudgments.

Feature 1: Custom Chatbot for Company Profile Pages

Context:
Each client has a dedicated company profile page showcasing key details such as their mission, products, office environment, leadership team, and tech stack [...].


Need:
We want to add an ""Ask Me Anything About the Company"" button (or chatbot), enabling users to ask questions and receive relevant answers without needing to specify the company, the model will automatically recognise which company the user is inquiring about based on the page they are viewing.

Training Dataset:
Our own written content
Transcripts from company videos/interviews
Client’s website content
Any additional available data

Bonus:
We aim to develop a system that allows us to train the model ourselves, reducing reliance on engineers.


Feature 2: Job description generation tailored to individual clients.

Context
Each client has a dedicated dashboard to post jobs on our platform. Since our clients come from diverse industries with unique requirements, the model must be fine-tuned to generate highly relevant job descriptions instead of generic ones.

Need
We want to add a ""Generate a Job Description"" button next to ""Job Description"" in our dashboard, using all the provided information above to create a structured draft.

Job Description Structure:
Company Overview – A high-level pitch of the company.
Hiring Reason – Why the company is recruiting.
Job Responsibilities – Key missions of the role.
Candidate Profile – Essential qualifications and skills.
Nice-to-Have Skills – Additional beneficial experience.
Benefits of working for the company – Further details on the organisation.
Last phrase inviting the user to learn more about the company with a redirect link to the company profile

Once generated, the job description populates in the appropriate field, allowing the user to make edits as needed.

Bonus Feature:
The model continuously learns from the user’s final job postings, refining future suggestions to match their individual preferences (beyond just company-wide adjustments).

Next Steps:
When the user clicks ""Publish Job"", an automation triggers another model to check formatting (correcting paragraph spacing, blanks, and punctuation…) without altering the content itself.

The idea is to keep all the job descriptions homogenous.

Overview

We propose developing an AI-powered platform that automates the analysis of legal orders and regulations, offering temporal and semantic insights through natural language search. This solution will help businesses, legal professionals, and policymakers navigate complex regulatory landscapes efficiently.

Problem Statement

Regulatory compliance and legal research are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Legal professionals spend countless hours parsing through vast amounts of legislative texts, amendments, and case laws to derive meaningful insights. This creates:
• Compliance Risks: Businesses struggle to keep up with evolving laws, leading to potential penalties.
• Inefficiency: Manual legal research is costly and slow.
• Lack of Contextual Understanding: Existing legal databases provide text search but lack deep reasoning capabilities.

Solution

Our AI-driven platform will:
1. Ingest & Structure Legal Data
• Parse and index thousands of legal documents (orders, statutes, regulations)
• Build a legal knowledge graph for tracking amendments, dependencies, and contradictions
• Use vector embeddings & NLP models to create contextual representations of laws
2. Enable Advanced Legal Reasoning
• Identify temporal relationships (precedence, repeals, amendments)
• Detect semantic relationships (contradictions, citations, modifications)
• Provide a natural language search interface for retrieving relevant legal information with just a question
3. Deliver Actionable Insights
• Generate explainable legal impact analysis
• Offer trend predictions on regulatory shifts
• Integrate with enterprise compliance systems to alert businesses on new regulatory risks



Business Model
• Subscription-Based SaaS: Access to the legal intelligence platform
• API Licensing: Integration with legal research & compliance tools
• Enterprise Consulting: Custom models for large corporations & law firms

Competitive Advantage
• Unlike traditional legal databases  our solution maps relationships between laws dynamically, allowing for real-time legal impact analysis.
• Unlike generic LLMs, our system is fine-tuned for legal reasoning, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
• Multi-jurisdiction support, enabling businesses to navigate cross-border regulations seamlessly.


This platform represents the next generation of AI-powered legal intelligence, transforming how businesses and legal professionals engage with complex regulations. With the right backing, we can disrupt the traditional legal research market and establish a new industry standard for regulatory analysis.",$25.00,$47.00,"['$25.00', '$47.00']",Expert,"['Google Cloud Platform', 'NestJS', 'Web Development', 'Discord', 'Web Design', 'Full-Stack Development', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'React', 'SQL', 'Python', 'PyTorch', 'Marketing Strategy', 'Node.js', 'Database Management', 'MongoDB', 'Neo4j', 'WordPress']",3-6 months,More than 30 hrs/week,5 to 10,0,0,0,$50,IND,2,3

The goal is to automate initial customer interactions, schedule appointments based on location, and integrate this data into the Markate CRM. The system should be seamless and feel human-like.

1. AI-Powered Texting Bot
- Functionality:
  - When a customer texts or calls, the AI bot will respond as if it were Brandon.
  - If a call is missed, the bot automatically sends:  
    *""Hey this is Brandon! Sorry for missing your call, I'm in a customer's house... Are you able to text? How can I help?""*
  - The bot should respond naturally and guide customers to schedule an appointment via a Calendly link.
  - Ensure the bot does NOT reveal it is AI.
  - Train the AI on Brandon's usual responses and tone to maintain authenticity.
  - **Brandon must have access to manually respond if needed.**

- Requirements:
  - AI model trained on Brandon’s past interactions.
  - API integration for SMS (Twilio recommended).
  - Ability to detect when a customer calls and trigger auto-text.
  - A manual override option for Brandon to take over the conversation if necessary.

---

2. Smart Scheduling via Calendly
- **Functionality:**
  - Customers will be directed to a scheduling link where they choose their city.
  - Cities: City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4.
  - Each hourly block should have **two slots** available.

- Requirements:
  - A dynamic Calendly setup with city-based scheduling.
  - API integration to categorize bookings based on city selection.

---

3. Markate CRM Integration
- **Functionality:**
  - Once a customer schedules an appointment via Calendly, their details need to be automatically entered into the **Leads** section of Markate CRM.
  - Brandon will manually move the lead to a ""Free Estimate"" slot in Markate.

- Challenges & Workarounds:
  - Markate doesn’t have a fully customizable API.
  - Data should be pushed into Markate’s existing Lead system through an automation tool like Zapier or Make.com.

- Requirements:
  - API integration (or webhooks) to push Calendly bookings into Markate.
  - Ensure customer name, phone number, and appointment details are properly mapped.

---

4. Lead Notification System
- **Functionality:**
  - When a lead books an appointment via Calendly, Brandon should receive a **text notification** with the lead’s details and appointment day.
  - The text should remind Brandon to **adjust the lead’s time slot** in Markate manually.

- Requirements:
  - SMS notification to Brandon’s personal phone when a new lead is created.
  - The text should include: Customer Name, Phone Number, Selected City, and Scheduled Date/Time.

---

Final Notes:
- The entire system must work **seamlessly and without friction** for the customer.
- The AI bot must feel **human-like** and **not robotic**.
- Automations should reduce manual input as much as possible while keeping Brandon in control of final scheduling.
- **Brandon must be able to manually intervene in AI conversations when necessary.**

Tools Required:
- Twilio (for AI texting & SMS notifications)
- Calendly (for scheduling)
- Markate CRM (for lead management)
- Zapier/Make.com (for integrations if direct API isn’t available)

The chat bot can either give the answer with natural language, or could pull up a list of forum posts that may be the same question the user is asking and let the user selected which one to open that thread.

The best case scenario would be a chat bot which gave an answer that was already answered by one of our pro moderators from the past and told the user that they should submit a new question if no match or similar question has been asked yet — but it should only say that if truly no similar question has been asked yet and should be capable of knowing when the same or a similar question has been asked previously.

UrbanChat is a scalable AI voice agent platform that allows businesses to sign up and build their own AI voice agents to handle customer calls. It works similarly to Retell AI, providing a fully automated AI-powered call-handling solution.

Our current setup integrates Twilio for telephony, ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech TTS, OpenAI Realtime 4o Mini for Speech-to-Text STT and LLM Natural Language Processing.

We want to restructure our architecture to be highly modular and flexible, allowing us to easily integrate multiple providers for each component without modifying the core backend.

Project Overview
Currently, our AI voice agent relies on:
✅ Telephony – Twilio for making and receiving calls
✅ TTS – ElevenLabs for AI-generated speech
✅ STT – OpenAI Realtime for transcribing user speech
✅ LLM – OpenAI for conversation intelligence

We want to decouple each of these components into separate modular frameworks, making it easy to integrate alternative providers without affecting other parts of the system.

Goals of This Project
Build a modular and scalable framework for Telephony, TTS, STT, and LLM.
Ensure that new providers can be added or swapped with minimal backend changes.
Maintain latency under 1000ms for real-time conversations.
Work on the existing codebase and refactor where needed.
Prepare comprehensive documentation including APIs and integration guidelines.
Your Role
You will be responsible for designing and implementing a modular architecture for the AI voice agent. This will involve breaking down the system into four independent frameworks:

1. Telephony Framework
Currently using Twilio, but should support other providers like Vonage, Exotel, etc.
Abstract call-handling logic so that switching providers requires minimal code changes.
Maintain lowest-latency communication between telephony and the AI engine.
Ensure compatibility with SIP, WebRTC, and standard telephony APIs.
Provide APIs for call initiation, phone number purchase, call handling, and termination.
From the backend, if we need to add another service provider, we should be able to integrate their API, and their phone numbers will be available for purchase on the frontend. This means customers can buy numbers from different providers directly through our platform.

2 TTS Text-to-Speech Framework
Currently using ElevenLabs, but should support Sarvam AI, Deepgram, Google TTS, etc.
Implement a standardized API for different TTS providers.
Ensure real-time streaming support for seamless voice interactions.
Optimize for low-latency response generation below 1000ms.
Provide fallback mechanisms in case a provider fails.

3 STT Speech-to-Text Framework
Currently using OpenAI Realtime, but should support Deepgram, Whisper, Google STT, etc.
Implement a plug-and-play interface for STT providers.
Maintain high transcription accuracy and low latency.
Support real-time streaming transcription for conversational AI.
Optimize handling of different accents, noise levels, and speech variations.

4 LLM AI Engine Framework
Currently using OpenAI GPT-4o Mini, but should support Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.
Design an API wrapper that allows switching between different AI models with minimal effort.
Optimize response generation for low latency and high conversation quality.
Support context-aware memory and multi-turn conversations.
Implement a fallback system in case of API failures or rate limits.

Expectations and Deliverables
✅ Modular Architecture
Each framework should be built as an independent module with a standardized API, so we can integrate any provider in the future with minimal changes.

✅ Real-Time Optimization
The entire system must maintain end-to-end latency under 1000ms, ensuring a smooth conversation experience.

✅ Code Refactoring and Integration
You will be working on our existing codebase, improving structure and modularity without breaking functionality.

✅ Comprehensive Documentation

Full API documentation for each framework.
Step-by-step guides for adding new providers.
Code structure explanations for future developers.
Who We Are Looking For
🔹 Experience with TTS, STT, LLM, and Telephony APIs Twilio, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Deepgram, Sarvam AI, etc.
🔹 Strong expertise in building modular and scalable architectures
🔹 Real-time speech processing and low-latency optimization
🔹 Familiarity with Node.js, Python, WebSockets, and cloud services
🔹 Prior experience in conversational AI or AI voice platforms is a huge plus
