android_developer,Create simple Web App for taxi business for customers to book trips online using escrow payment,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-simple-Web-App-for-taxi-business-for-customers-book-trips-online-using-escrow-payment_~021898377891861965802/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,1,Australia,"Web App Development: Online Taxi Booking System  

Overview
We need a simple yet efficient Web App for a small taxi business, allowing passengers to book trips online seamlessly. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for customers to enter trip details, calculate fares, make payments, and enable admins to manage bookings efficiently.



Core Features & Functionality

1. Customer Booking Form  
Customers should be able to enter the following details:  
- Customer Name  
- Customer mobile number
- Pick-up Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Drop-off Address (Google Maps integration for accurate input & auto-complete)  
- Number of Passengers
- Add Stop/Multiple Destinations Option (if required)  
- Date & Time Selection:
  - Book Now (immediate trip request)  
  - Schedule for Later (calendar-based date & time selection)  

2. Fare Calculation & Payment Processing  
- The system will calculate the trip fare based on a formula that we will provide later.  
- Customers proceed with payment, which will be held in escrow (or any better alternative recommended by the developer).  

3. Booking Approval Process (Admin Panel)  
- Admin receives a notification for each booking request.  
- Admin can Accept or Reject the booking.  
- If Rejected: Payment is automatically refunded, and the customer is notified with the reason (e.g., ""No driver available"").  
- If Accepted:  
  - Admin is prompted to assign the ride to a driver from a predefined driver list.  
  - Customer receives booking confirmation text with driver details  

4. Ride Completion & Cancellation Handling
- Once a ride is accepted, admin is prompted with:  
  - End Ride (indicating the trip was successfully completed).  
  - Ride Cancelled (if a cancellation occurs).  
- If the ride is cancelled after being accepted, the payment is refunded back to the customer automatically.  

5. Driver Management (Admin Panel)  
- Ability to maintain a list of drivers in the system.  
- Assign drivers to accepted rides.  
- Show assigned driver details to customers upon booking confirmation.  



Technical Considerations
- Google Maps API for location inputs and fare estimation.  
- Escrow-based payment solution (or developer‚Äôs recommendation for an alternative secure transaction system).  
- Admin Panel for managing bookings and drivers.  
- Responsive UI (desktop & mobile-friendly). We can provide this if needed.
- Scalability for future mobile app development (Android & iOS).  

We look forward to a long-term collaboration for future improvements and eventually mobile app development.  Looking forward to working with the right developer to help grow our small passenger transport business! üôè",3,"['Web Application', 'C#', 'JavaScript', 'PHP', 'Python', 'Square', 'Web Development', 'Haskell', 'Java', 'Payment Gateway Integration']",2,2.0,0.0,0.0,1400.0,0,43.0,19.0,50.0,1,0,0,1399.9999999999998

Hello,
We have developed a Quiz Elite-like Q&A application that helps students practice and learn by answering subject-related questions. Users can create rooms, compete with each other, and collaborate.

However, due to an unfortunate accident involving our previous developer, the project was left incomplete. We are now looking for a talented developer to finish the remaining features.

Pending Features:
‚úÖ Single-Player Mode: A system that allows users to play individually.
‚úÖ Live Chat System:

Students should be able to join admin-created rooms and chat live.

Moderation Controls:
Admin should be able to ban disruptive users and assign moderators.
Users should have the ability to block, report, or mute messages from inappropriate or disruptive individuals.
üí° Alternative Solution: The chat system does not necessarily have to be integrated within the app. We have our own server, so we can redirect users to a web-based chat system. A subdomain-based separate system is also an option. I trust your professional approach‚Äîmy priority is a reliable, fast, and seamless solution.

Our workers use a custom-built app to log their timesheets daily, and these records form the basis for payroll processing and client invoicing. However, our current system is inefficient because the backend database is on a separate platform from Google Sheets. As a result, our bookkeeper must manually copy and paste data between systems, slowing down operations.

Our goal is to integrate Google Sheets as the backend database to automate processes, streamline payroll, and eventually integrate AI-driven features for further efficiency.

Project Overview

We need an experienced developer to update our existing app while keeping the current functionality intact. The focus is on integrating Google Sheets as the backend database. We want to ensure that:

All worker, client, and timesheet data is stored and managed via Google Sheets.

The app frontend allows workers to sign up, log timesheets, and view payroll details.

Google Sheets remains fully synchronized with the app, allowing two-way data updates.

Our bookkeeper can manually update the Google Sheets database, and changes should be reflected in the app in real time.

If updating the existing app proves too difficult, we are open to developing a new version based on the current functionality, but with an improved and optimized backend using Google Sheets.

Scope of Work

Phase 1: Google Sheets Integration & App Update

Migrate the current app backend to Google Sheets.

Maintain current functionality while improving performance and stability.

Ensure that all app data (workers, clients, timesheets) is stored in structured Google Sheets tables.

Implement two-way synchronization between Google Sheets and the app.

Maintain existing timesheet calculations (overtime, night shifts, etc.) without rebuilding formulas.

Ensure payroll calculations and invoicing processes remain intact but operate directly from Google Sheets.

Optimize existing automation to reduce manual copy-pasting by our bookkeeper.

Phase 2: Future Developments (Optional, Long-Term Collaboration)

Email Automation: Implement MailerLite API integration for automated email sequences.

Contract Automation: Use SignNow API to automate contract submissions.

AI Agent Deployment: Develop AI agents to analyze worker data and assist in decision-making.

Chatbot Integration: Integrate with Chatbase or another chatbot that can read data in real time and provide workers with relevant information.

Further System Enhancements: Additional automation features to streamline labor hire operations.

Requirements

Proven experience in app development and backend integration.

Strong knowledge of Google Sheets API and real-time data synchronization.

Experience using AI tools for coding efficiency.

Ability to optimize processes while maintaining quality.

Experience with API integrations (MailerLite, SignNow, Chatbase, etc.).

Ability to work with our current designs or adapt to a Figma template.

How to Apply

If you‚Äôre interested in this project, please provide:

Examples of previous work relevant to app development and database integration.

Confirmation that you have the required skills.

Confirmation that you will use AI tools to optimize development speed and cost-effectiveness.

- The project involves creating an application for a company that provides software to local auctioneers and auction houses.
- The application's primary use case is inventory ingestion for heavy equipment brought to auction yards.
- The app aims to bridge the connection between inventory ingestion and catalog availability for online bidding.
- The company lacks expertise in React and React Native, despite having broad software experience.

Technical Challenges and Requirements
- The application must be offline-first due to poor connectivity in remote auction yards and warehouse locations.
- Data synchronization with the cloud is crucial and must be resilient to connection interruptions.
- The app uses Realm as a NoSQL database for local storage.
- Initial hydration of the application involves SSO-based or SAML 2 compliant authentication.
- Delta synchronization strategies are employed for new inventory and changes to existing inventory.
- The API is idempotent, allowing repeated application of changes without harming server-side data structures.
- Memory requirements on Android devices are more stringent due to the variety in device quality.

Current Implementation and Issues
- The application assumes entities are Realm entities, with persistence directly queried in some locations.
- Realm is used for both key-value and deeper level storage, including authentication, user data, and SAML 2 tokens.
- During beta testing, only 7 out of 67 pictures taken of one piece of equipment were successfully uploaded to storage.
- The developer suspects issues with object listening or state invalidation that require expertise in React Native to resolve.

Proposed Solutions and Development Approach
- The new developer suggests implementing a sync queue to store pending changes of Realm objects.
- Each entry in the sync queue will track its status (pending, in progress, failed).
- The sync logic will process the queue when the network is available, marking items as successful or retrying with a backoff strategy.
- Realm transactions will ensure data integrity during synchronization.
- Component lifecycles will be tied to Realm objects via subscriptions to prevent React Native errors when objects are deleted.

Work Style and Communication
- The developer typically works on an EST schedule, available from 9 AM to 5 or 6 PM.
- Daily updates and progress videos will be provided.
- The project uses an Expo system for receiving changes and providing new builds.
- Commits should be small and targeted, avoiding large refactors with numerous changes.
- Code reviews will be conducted throughout the day.

The app needs to prompt users to capture all required information, one photo at a time.

For example, the amount of ducts/pipes at each end of the pit/manhole.

On top of capturing this information in the photo, there will be check boxes to identify specific information.

On top of this, I would like the app to generate a sheet that documents and draws up that information, providing an overall pit/manhole layout.

I have sample sheets to show how these final sheets should look, and ideas on how we could capture this information accurately and easily.

The photos would need to save directly onto the phone being used, on the app, and potentially directly  onto a selected folder.

I have ideas on how I would see this being a useful tool, but I'm open to suggestions.

Is it possible to take a photo of the end of a pit or manhole, then have options to select certain ducts on the pit wall, and flag them as a certain size, and also what remaining capacity they have?

If you look at the photo attached, you will see the side of a manhole with multiple ducts. These vary in size and remaining capacity.  

I imagine being able to click a duct on the photo, then click a check box that specifies a size and another that specifies a remaining capacity (what can still fit in the duct, with what's already there)

The platform should allow users to complete geolocated challenges, earn points and badges, and see their ranking on a global leaderboard.
I understand that a web app is more cost-effective than a native mobile app (Android/iOS), but if possible, I would love to receive a quotation for both. My priority is to start with the web app, and if it gains traction, I would like to complement it with a mobile app.
üîπ Main Requirements:
‚úÖ User Registration/Login: Email, Google, Facebook, TikTok.
‚úÖ User Profile: Photo, name, counter of completed challenges, points, earned badges, and a summary of transportation methods used (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Challenge System: A predefined list of challenges created by me or premium users, categorized by type and location.
‚úÖ Statistics Section: Similar to Polarsteps, users should be able to see personalized travel stats, including:
‚Ä¢ Number of challenges completed
‚Ä¢ % of each open challenge completed
‚Ä¢ Total locations visited
‚Ä¢ Distance traveled
‚Ä¢ Number of different transportation methods used
‚Ä¢ Most visited countries/cities
‚Ä¢ Etc.
‚úÖ Bulk Challenge Upload: I already have 1,000 challenge locations in Mexico, and the system must allow easy mass uploads, as the number of locations will continue to grow with each new country and challenge category I add. This should be considered in terms of database scalability and performance.
‚úÖ Challenge Proof Submission: Users must upload at least one photo per challenge location.
‚úÖ Automatic Approval: Challenges should be auto-approved, but with an option for manual moderation if necessary.
‚úÖ Points and Badges: Each destination will grant points, and upon reaching specific milestones, users will earn collectible badges.
‚úÖ Open Check-in: Users should be able to check in at any location on the map, but badges can only be earned by completing the predefined challenges.
‚úÖ Ranking and Gamification: A global and city-based leaderboard based on earned points.
‚úÖ Geolocated Challenges: Users must physically visit designated locations to complete challenges.
‚úÖ Challenges Without a Specific Location: I need the ability to add challenges that don‚Äôt require a fixed location, such as:
‚Ä¢ Trying a specific dish
‚Ä¢ Skydiving
‚Ä¢ Rafting
‚Ä¢ Hiking or trekking
‚úÖ Transport Mode Selection: Users should specify how they arrived at the location (car, bus, motorcycle, motorhome, bicycle, etc.).
‚úÖ Monetization:
‚Ä¢ Phase 1: Integration with AdSense and premium subscriptions.
‚Ä¢ Phase 2: Expansion to sponsorships, collaborations, and merchandise.
‚úÖ Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop, with an adventurous style similar to Polarsteps.
‚úÖ Multilanguage Support: The platform should support multiple languages from the start.
‚úÖ Easy Management: I need to be able to add new challenges, moderate content, and manage basic daily operations.
‚úÖ Training: I will need assistance learning how to manage the platform after launch.
‚úÖ International Expansion: I already have example challenges in Mexico, but I am preparing challenges for other countries.
üîπ Example Challenge Categories (Mexico):
These will serve as a model for expanding challenges to other countries:
1. Pueblos M√°gicos ‚Äì Culturally and historically significant towns.
2. Pre-Hispanic Mexico ‚Äì Archaeological sites and pre-Hispanic heritage zones.
3. Mexico‚Äôs Beaches & Coasts ‚Äì Popular coastal destinations.
4. Blue Mexico ‚Äì Lagoons, rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.
5. Green Mexico ‚Äì Natural reserves, mountains, forests, and ecological parks.
6. Mexico‚Äôs Capital Cities ‚Äì Major state capitals.
7. Famous Roads ‚Äì Iconic travel routes, especially for motorcyclists.
8. Mexican Landmarks ‚Äì Monuments and emblematic sites across cities.
9. Gastronomy ‚Äì Destinations famous for their traditional food.
10. Scenic Routes ‚Äì Roads with breathtaking views ideal for road trips.

üîπ Quotation Request:
I would like to know:
‚Ä¢ Your development proposal (recommended technologies and approach).
‚Ä¢ Estimated delivery time for the project.
‚Ä¢ Total cost based on the described functionalities.
‚Ä¢ Your post-launch support options (if available).
‚Ä¢ Payment terms: How would payments be structured (upfront, milestone-based, upon completion, etc.)?
‚Ä¢ Quotation for a mobile app (Android/iOS) in case I decide to complement the web app in the future.
Please send me a detailed quotation along with any recommendations you might have.
Looking forward to your response and the possibility of working together! üöÄ

The MJPEG frame does not contain the correct SOI (Start of Image) ‚Äî the first two bytes, which should be 0xFF and 0xD8 respectively. In our case, SOI: 00 means that the first byte points to an incorrect SO

Sometimes a frame can be corrupted due to unstable communication or other factors that can corrupt its structure. It will be necessary to buffer several frames and only then pass them for decoding. This can help to assemble the frame from several parts.

4Ô∏è‚É£ App Platforms & Web Integration

The app is being developed for iOS (mobile & tablet) using Swift & SwiftUI.
We also want to integrate a web app version in the future, so experience with React, Next.js, or similar frameworks is a plus.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Quality & Speed are Critical

Version 1.0 is already halfway done‚Äîwe need faster progress without sacrificing quality.
Version 2.0 development will start soon, and we want a structured, high-quality approach.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Long-Term Opportunities

Beyond this project, we have ambitious plans for future updates (Version 3.0+), an Android version, and additional advanced scouting and analytics features.

Both pages require modification of the existing Flutter initiation from within the FlutterFlow app when a button ""Send"" is clicked.  This opens the user's SMS interface with a message and a link to the we based document (either Estimate or Invoice).  

Estimate: When the recipient clicks on the link, they see an estimate for services (like plumbing or painting) and can hit an Approve button.  This gets saved to the Firebase database.

Invoice: When the recipient clicks on the link, they see an invoice for services (like plumbing or painting) and can hit one of the payment buttons.  The first release will start with simple integration for the following: Venmo, PayPal and Zelle.  When the user clicks on any of these, it will open up the payment app in question with 3 pieces of information: the receiving person's identification, the amount and a description (which contains the invoice ID concatenated with the textual description of the project).

Project Responsibilities:
- Develop an Android application using the DJI Mobile SDK v5.

- Relay take-off, landing, return-to-home (RTH) and virtual stick commands from a remote server to the drone.
- Forward the realtime video feed and telemetry data from the drone through gRPC to the server.
- Integrate gRPC and Protobuf definitions provided for the communication protocol.
- Each command is valid for 100ms. A new command received should replace the current command immediately. After a command is expired the sticks are expected to return to the neutral position to make the drone hover.
- The application UI is minimal
    - A text field to enter the remote gRPC server URL. This should be persisted across app restarts and allow pasting of URLs.
    - The app connection status to the drone controller.
- Ensure reliable and low-latency communication between the server and the drone.
- Collaborate with our team to test and refine the application for optimal performance and stability.
- Support gRPC connections over SSL for security.
- There is no need to implement any authentication.
- Please include a simple Go gRPC server to test your implementation. It is sufficient if it makes the drone take off, issue a few stick commands, saves the video frames to a file and lands the drone. Please also test the command expiry logic.
- The application will control a DJI Mini 3, but any supported Mobile SDK DJI drone should work and can be used for app development.
- The application is expected to run indefinitely with no other applications being used at the same time.

This is the MVP, so we‚Äôre keeping it lean ‚Äì core features include audio/video content playback, an AI chatbot, mood tracking, and Firebase integration for content storage. We have complete Figma designs ready to go.

A big part of this is building a ""mood engine"" ‚Äî the app should track and determine the user‚Äôs mood in real time based on interactions with the chatbot, what content they watch, how they rate it, etc in order to recommend content and provide a beneficial user experience. If you like thinking through logic like that and building creative algorithms (not just coding screens), that‚Äôs a big plus.

What We‚Äôre Looking For:

-Experience building cross-platform apps (React Native preferred)
-Comfortable working with OpenAI API and Firebase
-Experience with video/audio playback in mobile apps
-Able to bring our Figma designs to life in a clean, modern way
-Good communicator who can work independently but keeps us in the loop
-Bonus: If you are a creative thinker and like solving product problems (like how to detect mood changes from user behavior), that would be awesome.

Timeline:

We‚Äôre aiming to get this done in about 4-6 weeks, so we need someone who can start soon and work fast.

Budget:

We are a lean self-funded startup so our budget is small at this stage. We are looking for someone that is willing to work with our limited budget for the time being and that is ideally interested in growing with us as we seek funding post-launch.

To Apply:

Please share:

-A few examples of apps you‚Äôve built, preferably iOS app (bonus if they have chat or content streaming features)
-Which framework and programming language you prefer to work in and why
-If you have experience building logic engines, recommendation systems, or tracking user activity or states inside apps, let us know.
-Any other information on why you are the best developer for this project.

prevention.
Creating an accessible and user-friendly app or IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system for
preeclampsia involves a few key components that ensure the information is both accurate and
easily understood by a diverse audience. Here‚Äôs a structured approach to designing such a
system:
1. Target Audience
‚Ä¢ Primary Users: Pregnant individuals, family members, healthcare providers, and
caregivers.
‚Ä¢ Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to individuals with different needs, such
as visual impairments (through screen readers) and hearing impairments (with
transcripts or visual cues).
2. Core Features for the App/IVR System
Information Sections
‚Ä¢ Symptoms of Preeclampsia:
o Clear, simple explanations of common symptoms (high blood pressure, swelling,
protein in urine, headaches, visual disturbances, etc.).
o Use of simple, everyday language and audio-visual elements (in the app) like
images and infographics.
o Interactive Q&A for personalized symptom checking (for apps).
‚Ä¢ Risk Factors:
o List common risk factors (high blood pressure, age, first pregnancy, multiple
pregnancies, etc.).
o Explanation of when users should contact a doctor (in case of risk factor
identification).
‚Ä¢ Lifestyle Guidance:
o Healthy living tips during pregnancy (nutrition, exercise, stress management).
o Guidelines for monitoring and controlling blood pressure.
o Recommendations for rest and hydration.
‚Ä¢ Prevention:
o Overview of how preeclampsia can be prevented or mitigated through lifestyle
and medical care.
o Encouragement to attend regular prenatal checkups.
Personalization (for the app):
‚Ä¢ Allow users to input their age, health conditions, and pregnancy details to get
personalized information or alerts.
‚Ä¢ A checklist for ongoing health monitoring (e.g., blood pressure, swelling, etc.).
Emergency Alerts & Support:
‚Ä¢ Clear instructions on when to seek immediate medical help.
‚Ä¢ Easy access to emergency contact numbers, or the ability to connect directly to a
medical professional through the app or IVR system.
3. Designing for Accessibility
For the App:
‚Ä¢ Text-to-Speech: Use text-to-speech technology to allow users to listen to the
information.
‚Ä¢ Large Font and High Contrast Mode: Include options for users to adjust text size and
contrast for easier reading.
‚Ä¢ Multilingual Support: Provide translations for non-English-speaking users, if necessary.
‚Ä¢ Voice Commands: Allow users to navigate the app using voice commands (useful for
users with physical impairments).
‚Ä¢ Clear Navigation: Use simple, intuitive icons, large buttons, and concise wording.
‚Ä¢ Visual Cues: For example, use a color system (green, yellow, red) to indicate the severity
of symptoms or actions to take.
For the IVR System:
‚Ä¢ Simple, Clear Voice Prompts: Use natural, slow-paced speech with minimal jargon.
Use clear prompts like ""Press 1 for symptoms,"" ""Press 2 for risk factors,"" and ""Press 3 for
lifestyle guidance.""
‚Ä¢ Step-by-Step Guidance: Break down information into small chunks and provide the
option to repeat or go back.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: If users enter an incorrect option, provide a friendly prompt to guide
them back to the main menu.
‚Ä¢ Accessible for Hearing Impaired: Provide an option to switch to text-based support, or
allow users to request a call-back from a healthcare professional.
4. User Experience (UX) Design
‚Ä¢ Easy Navigation: Whether in the app or IVR, users should be able to easily navigate and
find the information they need without feeling overwhelmed.
‚Ä¢ Engaging and Reassuring Tone: Keep the language empathetic and supportive. For
example, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to help you stay healthy during your pregnancy.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Regular Updates: Offer push notifications or voice prompts for important reminders,
like prenatal checkups or self-monitoring tips.
‚Ä¢ Progress Tracking: Allow users to log their symptoms or health data (like blood
pressure) and track progress over time.
5. Content Development
‚Ä¢ Accurate Information: Collaborate with obstetricians, gynecologists, and healthcare
professionals to ensure all information provided is medically accurate and evidencebased.
‚Ä¢ Simple Language: Use plain language that is easy for the general public to understand.
‚Ä¢ Multimedia Integration: In the app, include videos, images, and audio descriptions for
complex information.
‚Ä¢ Regular Review and Update: Medical guidelines change, so ensure the app or IVR is
regularly updated to reflect new research or guidelines.
6. Integration with Healthcare Providers
‚Ä¢ Direct Connection: Allow users to share information directly with their healthcare
providers (through the app) or connect with a doctor through the IVR system.
‚Ä¢ Notifications for Healthcare Providers: The app could alert a healthcare provider if a
user logs concerning symptoms.
7. Data Privacy and Security
‚Ä¢ Compliance: Ensure the app and IVR system follow relevant health privacy laws (like
HIPAA in the U.S.) to protect user data.
‚Ä¢ Secure Communication: Any sharing of health data should be encrypted and secure.
8. Testing and Feedback
‚Ä¢ User Testing: Conduct usability testing with pregnant individuals from diverse
backgrounds to ensure the app or IVR system is easy to use and accessible.
‚Ä¢ Feedback Mechanism: Allow users to provide feedback so the system can continuously
improve based on real-world use.
9. Promotion and Awareness
‚Ä¢ Work with healthcare providers, maternity centers, and public health organizations to
promote the app/IVR system to those who may benefit the most.
Great! Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the UX/UI design and some technical aspects, as well as sample
content for the app. These areas will help bring the vision for your accessible and user-friendly
app/IVR system to life.
1. UX/UI Design for the App
Key Principles for UX/UI Design:
‚Ä¢ Simplicity & Minimalism: Avoid clutter. Focus on easy-to-follow steps and a clear,
intuitive interface.
‚Ä¢ Clear and Consistent Navigation: Use familiar icons and easy-to-understand language.
Minimize the number of steps a user needs to take to access information.
‚Ä¢ Responsive Design: Ensure that the app works well on a range of devices and screen
sizes (smartphones, tablets).
‚Ä¢ Empathetic and Supportive Tone: Use language that is gentle, reassuring, and nonintimidating.
UI Components to Focus On:
‚Ä¢ Home Screen:
o Primary Navigation: Buttons for each main section (Symptoms, Risk Factors,
Prevention, Lifestyle Tips, My Health). Use large, easy-to-tap buttons with high
contrast (for visibility).
o Urgency Indicator: A prominent button or alert for ""Emergency Symptoms"" that
quickly connects the user to emergency resources or advice.

symptoms logged, upcoming checkups) with friendly reminders like ‚ÄúYour next
appointment is tomorrow.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Symptom Checker Screen:
o Step-by-Step Guide: Let users input symptoms through yes/no questions or
checkboxes. For instance:
ÔÇß ""Do you have swelling in your hands or feet?""
ÔÇß ""Have you had any severe headaches recently?""
o Based on the answers, the system provides a risk level (e.g., low, moderate, high)
and gives personalized advice. Keep this clear and action-oriented: ‚ÄúIf you are
experiencing severe headaches, contact your healthcare provider immediately.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Information Cards:
o Symptoms, Risk Factors, Prevention: Each topic (e.g., Symptoms) could be
broken down into short, digestible cards that provide brief explanations. For
example, for ""Swelling,"" the card could read:
ÔÇß Title: ""Swelling""
ÔÇß Text: ""Swelling of the face, hands, or feet may be a sign of preeclampsia.
Monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if swelling occurs
rapidly or is accompanied by other symptoms.""
ÔÇß Action Button: ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù (Expands for more details).
‚Ä¢ Audio Features:
o Text-to-Speech: Each card or information section should have an option to be
read aloud. Include a button for this function next to the text.

‚Ä¢ Emergency Call Button: Always present in the top-right or bottom-right corner of the
screen as a floating action button. When tapped, it should either dial emergency
services or display emergency information.
Color Scheme & Accessibility Considerations:
‚Ä¢ High Contrast: Use high contrast colors like dark text on a light background (or vice
versa) to improve readability for people with visual impairments.
‚Ä¢ Color-blind Friendly: Use color schemes that are friendly for users with color blindness
(e.g., red-green colorblind users) by incorporating patterns or text labels along with
colors to convey meaning.
‚Ä¢ Adjustable Font Sizes: Include an option in settings for users to change text size
according to their needs.
2. Technical Aspects

The app should display the amount of walked steps per day since it was started the first time. As data source you have to use Android's Sensor API. It is very important that you **DO NOT** use Google Fit or Google Health and solely rely on the value you can obtain through the Android's Sensor API (https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_motion)

**You should write a Native Module** that reads the step count via the Sensor API and makes that value available to Expo to render it on screen. Render the value centered on the screen. Black text on a white background. No need to spend time on styling, splash screen, graphics, app icon, upload to Google Play etc., as I am **ONLY** interested in the way how to access the step count from Expo.

You have to use the latest version of Expo and Kotlin (**VERY IMPORTANT**). Expo has simplified the way to create native modules through their Expo Modules API, so this link is a good starting point: https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/

## Deliveries
- Source code for the step counter app (as described above)

## Requirements
- Write your **own** native module to read the step count from the Android Sensor API
- **DO NOT** use the Google Fit or Google Health API
- **DO NOT** use the Expo Pedometer API as it is broken on Android (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/9463)
- From TypeScript you should be able to call your native module via a function like `getCurrentStepCount()` to retrieve that value. Call that function within a `setInterval()` every 5 seconds
- 1 screen showing the current step count per day on a white background in the center and nothing else, e.g. ""2025-03-01: 8.666 steps | 2025-03-02: 7.653 steps | etc.""
- When the app is terminated by the user or the Android OS the step counting has to keep working.
- **DO NOT** use a Foreground Service to avoid getting terminated by the OS, as I do not want to show a notification on screen all the time (+ it drains the battery)
- Your proof of concept app should get the current step count from the Sensor API and persist it to storage  every 15 minutes, so when the app is opened you can attribute the walked steps to the respective day. Image you do not open the app for 3 days and you still want to know how many steps where walked on each day.

The app supports users by streamlining text documentation for a third-party web system. The current app records notes via our website, transcribes them using the Deepgram API, processes them with OpenAI GPT prompts for formatting, and imports the text into the third-party system‚Äôs web fields via a Chrome extension. We need this functionality to work on mobile devices (iPhone, Android, tablets) that don‚Äôt support Chrome extensions, while retaining all features, including automated field imports and a secondary ""starter phrases"" tool.

Current Workflow:

Recording & Processing: Users record notes on our website. The audio is transcribed via Deepgram API, then processed by OpenAI GPT (via multiple prompts) to sort and rewrite the text for compatibility with the target system. Processed texts are saved and organized by date for users to import.
Text Import: On the third-party web system, users click the Chrome extension icon in the browser toolbar, opening a popup with a sorted list of transcribed texts. Selecting an entry auto-fills relevant text fields, and based on the text content, it may interact with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., checking an option or selecting from a list).
Starter Phrases: With the extension installed, small icons appear in the system‚Äôs text boxes. Users click these to save or insert pre-defined ""starter phrases"" for rapid input.
Project Goals:

Build a PWA that replicates the recording, transcription, and processing workflow.
Replace the Chrome extension with a bookmarklet that works on mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome), displaying a floating overlay with sorted transcribed texts for import into the target system‚Äôs fields.
Ensure the bookmarklet can auto-fill multiple text fields, trigger checkboxes, and select dropdowns based on text content.
Adapt the ""starter phrases"" feature for mobile, either via the bookmarklet overlay or a similar mechanism.
Optimize for affordability, reliability, and mobile usability (iPhone, Android, tablets).
Key Features:

PWA Interface:
Mobile-friendly UI for recording audio notes (via browser mic access).
Integrate Deepgram API for transcription and OpenAI API for text processing (existing prompts provided).
Store and display processed texts, sorted by date (e.g., ""March 2, 2025: 10:15 AM"").
Cloud syncing (e.g., Firebase) for cross-device access.
Bookmarklet Integration:
On the third-party web system, users trigger a bookmarklet to show a floating overlay with the sorted text list.
Selecting an entry auto-fills text fields (e.g., identified by ""notes"") and interacts with checkboxes or dropdowns (e.g., identified by ""stable"").
Handle the system‚Äôs HTML structure (will provide sample pages or field IDs if needed).
Starter Phrases:
Replicate the text box icons as a mobile-friendly feature (e.g., overlay buttons or a separate bookmarklet mode).
Allow saving and inserting phrases into the system‚Äôs fields.
Compatibility:
Works on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome), with testing on both.
Fallback to clipboard copy/paste if the system blocks DOM manipulation.
Deliverables:

Fully functional PWA hosted on a platform like Vercel or Firebase.
Bookmarklet script with overlay UI for integration with the target system.
Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
Testing report confirming functionality on iPhone and Android with the third-party system.

Skills Required:

Web Development: Strong proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, or vanilla JS).
PWA Experience: Proven experience building Progressive Web Apps with responsive design, Service Workers, and offline capabilities.
Bookmarklet/DOM Manipulation: Familiarity with writing bookmarklets or scripts to interact with third-party website DOMs (e.g., querySelector, event triggers).
API Integration: Experience with REST APIs (e.g., Deepgram, OpenAI) for audio transcription and text processing.
Mobile Browser Compatibility: Knowledge of Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) quirks, including Clipboard API and mic access.
Database/Storage: Basic experience with cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) or local storage (IndexedDB).
Debugging: Ability to troubleshoot cross-browser issues and security restrictions (e.g., CSP).",3,"['AI App Development', 'AI Model Integration', 'HTML', 'Web Development', 'Payment Gateway Integration', 'CSS', 'Full-Stack Development', 'React', 'WordPress', 'WooCommerce', 'AI Agent Development', 'Web Application', 'PHP', 'JavaScript']",6,3.0,0.0,0.0,13000.0,3,2.0,0.0,30.0,0,1,0,12999.99999999999

The app will be tested on our farm initially, with potential for future expansion. We need a skilled Flutter developer to build a functional version with a specific interface design (see details below) and a basic web dashboard. Most of our team uses iPhones, so iOS support is required. Different sites have different bin sizes, and the app must allow users to choose the appropriate bin capacity. The home screen will list sites for selection, with administrators having the ability to edit or add new sites, including the number of bins and bin sizes, which remain static unless changed by the admin.
