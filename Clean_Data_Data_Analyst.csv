126,Data_Analyst,Airbnb Short-Term Rental Pricing Strategy in Google Sheets (Dynamic Formula + Automation),https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Airbnb-Short-Term-Rental-Pricing-Strategy-Google-Sheets-Dynamic-Formula-Automation_~021896334986496576999/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs/,Fixed-price,"I am seeking an experienced Google Sheets developer (or data analyst with strong spreadsheet skills) to create a dynamic pricing strategy model for short-term rentals on Airbnb. The sheet aims to integrate various data inputs—occupancy, average daily rates (ADR), and comp set percentile positions—into a streamlined, automated Google Sheets environment.

I previously worked with another freelancer on this project, but due to timing, we were unable to finalize the solution. I now need a reliable expert who can pick up and improve upon existing google sheet files and deliver a robust, user-friendly tool that my team and I can easily maintain.

Background

Objective: Build an automated system in Google Sheets to project short-term rental pricing across weekdays, weekends, and holidays while factoring in occupancy and “comp set” percentile positioning. There are three more tabs that are laid out but need formulas to connect the backend data dump as well.

Existing Assets:
Multiple partially completed Google Sheets with tabular logic, occupant-based formulas, and references to comp set percentile data.
A script meant to handle CSV imports (e.g., 12 to 18 months of historical and upcoming data) but needs debugging and enhancement.
Loom videos demonstrating the initial approach, formulas, and advanced tasks (e.g., capturing the “relevant price percentile ADR,” pulling in occupancy data, etc.).
CSV files containing raw occupancy and revenue data for multiple listings.

What I Need Done:
Data Import & Parsing
Finalize or rebuild the script that ingests CSV data (12–18 months’ worth), correctly handles duplicated months, and appends or overwrites existing data as necessary.
Ensure the import script can be triggered on-demand by a button or menu item in Google Sheets.
Dynamic Pricing Formula

Create (or refine) formulas that incorporate separate logic for weekdays vs. weekends/holidays.

Dashboard & Visualization

Develop a dedicated “Dashboard” tab pulling from the processed data to display (90% done):

Testing & Validation

Thoroughly test the final formulas and scripts using sample CSV data for accuracy and ease of use.
Provide clear instructions or Loom videos explaining how to maintain and adjust the system.

Deliverables
One fully working Google Sheet:
Automated CSV Import Script
Clean, well-labeled pricing logic and formulas for accurate data analysis and adjustments.

Ideal Freelancer
Expert in Google Sheets (queries, array formulas, scripts in Apps Script).
Familiar with short-term rental revenue management (occupancy, ADR, comp sets, dynamic pricing concepts).
Excellent communication—willing to provide Looms or detailed instructions on how to use the tool.
Proactive problem-solver who can suggest best practices for automation and clarity.

Timeline: Prefer a 2–3 week turnaround, with frequent check-ins or milestone deliveries to ensure alignment.

How to Apply
Relevant Experience: Share any related Google Sheets, formuals, and automation you’ve completed.

Availability: When can you start, and how soon could you deliver a first draft?

We’ll schedule a short introductory call after reviewing proposals to clarify the scope, walk you through the partial Sheet we have, and confirm next steps.

It will function somewhat as an interview, because I would like this person to stay on for the ongoing engagement.

This project will be used to help us identify real estate investment opportunities and so data accuracy is critical. We need someone who is focused on the impact and quality of the analysis more than we need speed. As such, I would like your estimate of what it costs to complete this, but would prefer to pay by the hour, to improve alignment, and encourage discussion and collaboration between us while you work.

I don’t expect one person to be able to be able to do all of these, but the more coverage one person can provide the better. Relatedly, I’m interested in people who have existing relationships with other developers/data analysts who they can work with to take on more of the project as a team, to the extent needed.

For the initial project, I want to develop a raster map of the United States with each point containing the total population within a 3-mile radius of said point.

I’m open to suggestions for how to approach this, but my initial thinking is as follows:
• Pull population data from the US Census by Census Block (or open to suggestions for better sources)
• Pull Census Block polygons/boundaries, which I assume are also available on the Census website
• Convert population numbers to population densities.
    o The census tracks block areas with and without water areas included. Ideally, you can convert water areas to “zero population” in the raster, and show the remaining points as the population density excluding bodies of water.
    o I’m very much open to suggestions for better ways to estimate population densities.
• With a pixelized map of the population density of the United States, add together the resulting population within three miles of each point.

Again if you see a better way to accomplish this, please let me know!

I will eventually want to take a more advanced approach here to estimating the distributions of populations within Census Block groups, so would like to hear any suggestions you might have on ways to approach this.

We have a dataset of approximately 30,000 rows based on invoices, containing CO₂ data, supplier information, costs, and various classifications. Our goal is to build an impactful and highly useful dashboard in Looker that not only provides a high-level summary of sustainability data but also enables deep analytical exploration (drill-downs).

What we need help with:
- Strategic setup & integration: You should be familiar with Google Cloud Platform and Looker (data is stored in BigQuery) to ensure a smooth and effective setup. However, getting everything ‘technically perfect’ is less important than ensuring the data delivers valuable insights.
- Dashboard & visualization: Develop a clear and actionable dashboard that highlights key sustainability metrics (e.g., total CO₂, costs, supplier overview) while allowing users to drill down into specific areas for deeper analysis.
- Analytical approach: We need someone who goes beyond the technical setup and can think about what questions the data should answer. You will be expected to contribute ideas on which key metrics, dimensions, and analyses matter most for understanding and improving sustainability efforts.
- Advisory role: Provide input on how to structure and model the data to uncover insights and offer fresh perspectives on sustainability.

Who we are looking for:
- Business & analytical mindset: You understand how to extract real business value from data and can suggest the right types of analyses and data manipulations.
- Technical expertise: Strong experience with Google Cloud Platform, particularly BigQuery and Looker.
- Sustainability knowledge (a plus): Experience with CO₂ emissions data, environmental calculations, or sustainability-related analytics is highly valued.
- Communication skills: Ability to explain complex data insights in a clear and engaging way, both visually and in written documentation.

- Design a dashboard that provides both high-level KPIs and granular drill-downs for further investigation.
- Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and adaptable, allowing for easy updates as new data becomes available.
- Suggest ways to improve data collection and structuring to enhance long-term analytical value.

How to apply:
Please provide:
- A short description of your experience with Looker, BigQuery, and Google Cloud.
- Examples of past dashboards or projects you’ve built—ideally where data was used to drive business decisions, not just for reporting.
- A brief outline of how you would approach this project (key steps and priorities).
- Estimated time requirements and your availability.

Timeline & scope:
- The project can start immediately.
- We aim to have a first working version within a few weeks but are flexible on exact timing.
- If this collaboration goes well, there’s potential for ongoing work.

Such gaps often stem from issues related to data completeness and data sharing. Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and potential solutions:

1. Data Completeness Issues
Challenges:
Inconsistent Data Entry: LEAs may not collect all MMUCC-recommended fields, leading to missing or incomplete data.
Varied Reporting Standards: States may have unique crash report formats that don’t align with MMUCC.
Standardized Digital Reporting: Implement state-mandated electronic crash reporting systems with required MMUCC fields.

2. Data Sharing Challenges
Challenges:
Lack of Centralized Systems: Many states have separate databases that aren’t integrated, making cross-agency data sharing difficult.
Interoperability Issues: Different states and LEAs use various reporting platforms that may not communicate with each other.
Data Format Inconsistencies: Differences in how crash data is recorded (e.g., structured vs. unstructured data) create integration challenges.

Deliverable;
Your output will be a technical paper clearly identifying gaps in current MMUCC model data sharing and data completeness within existing software offerings.

The migration will be performed in an ""As Is"" format, meaning a clean replication of the same queries from Synapse to Databricks, using the structure already created by one of our analysts, organized into notebooks and scheduled via workflows for daily loads.

Databricks was deployed in the PRJ-INGESTÃO-DE-DADOS-BI project, utilizing the shared network PRJ-HOST-NETWORK to align with security policies.

A cluster was created with a cost-effective configuration, ensuring optimization without compromising data ingestion pipeline processing capacity, along with the installation of the JDBC library.

The Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers were structured in Google Cloud Storage, ensuring organization, modularity, and scalability of the environment.

With the infrastructure set up, the project will move forward with implementing data ingestion pipelines while maintaining the logic, queries, and business rules from Azure.  

Additionally, the resource must clone the Power BI dashboards currently hosted in Microsoft's Azure cloud and upload them to the designated workspace for dashboards in GCP.

Once migrated, the data sources within the dashboards must be repointed to Databricks, ensuring that all dashboards function seamlessly with the new data infrastructure.

The goal of the project is to migrate all the pipelines and have cloned dashboards in perfect condition, identical to the production environment.  

The code structure includes:

extracting data from the Bronze layer (tables such as *[REDACTED], *[REDACTED]*, and *[REDACTED]**, consolidated via UNION ALL);

type conversion and column creation (e.g., CD_ATENDIMENTO converted to DOUBLE, CD_SERVICO converted to DECIMAL (38,0), DS_TIP_MAR converted to STRING);

creation of surrogate keys to ensure uniqueness and traceability (such as SK_FATO_ATENDIMENTO, SK_FATO_PACIENTE, SK_ESPECIALID, SK_CONVENIO, SK_CID, SK_LEITOS, SK_ORI_ATE, and SK_PRESTADOR);

data enrichment by adding a DATA_CARGA column (formatted as dd/MM/yyyy);

column selection to include the created surrogate keys and relevant attributes;

saving transformed data in the Silver layer via saveTableFileSilver (""DIM_ATENDIMENTO"", df);

saving validated data in the Gold layer using saveTableFileGold (""lwd_dim_atendimento_01"", df);

and data visualization by loading a Parquet file for validation and display.  

This ETL process is designed to consolidate data from multiple sources into the Bronze layer, enrich it in the Silver layer, and make it available in the Gold layer for advanced analytics.

Databricks Workflows will be used to orchestrate task execution, allowing flexible automation and integration with other systems.

The detailed workflow functionality includes adding tasks, where each step represents a phase in the pipeline, ensuring an efficient automation process for data migration, transformation, and dashboard replication.",Expert,"['ETL Pipeline', 'Data Modeling', 'Databricks Platform', 'Database Design', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Microsoft Power BI Development']",20 to 50,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,Brazil,,,10000.0,0,0,1

Perform data analysis and research and share findings. Use MS Excel, raw data files provided, online resources, and any other tools or resources at contractor's discretion, to identify instances where vendors are delivering similar services to and/or across 2 or more sub-organizations(known as bureaus) within the Department of Commerce(DOC).

The goal is to highlight evidence of such scenarios in a new Excel (.xlsx) output file and provide a summary of findings.

The purpose and business goal of this exercise is to enable the Department of Commerce to avoid duplicative costs via negotiation with vendors for a more competitive rate, or the removal of redundant contracts/services.

Objective Context/Background:

• If the vendor ""Thundercat"" is providing AWS brokerage services to MBDA(bureau 1), but providing cyber-security services to EDA(bureau 2) - that's not a significant or value-added analytics finding.........because separate services doesn't present a lot of opportunity for consolidation or cost savings with that one vendor.
• However, if that one/single vendor is providing the SAME exact product or service across 2 or more bureaus - then that's an analytical finding or outcome we want to document and point to in our discussions with our stakeholders

Tasks:
1. Review all data
2. Perform analysis to identify contract overlap across bureaus/organizations
3. Utilize external/public resources as needed to find out exactly which services/products were offered as part of contract
4. Try to realize the most granular levels of contract detail possible to ensure that 2/more bureaus are using the same exact product or service

Timeline:
1. Prefer to receive first draft of results/findings by end of Sunday (at 9PM EST U.S.)
2. This would allow for any updated iterations/revisions by 12Noon Monday (EST U.S.), based on review of Sunday's findings

Resources/Data:
1. DOC_FPDS_IT_Data_FY24_YTD_11142024 Excel - This file includes DOC data extracted from the PFDS system, and useful data inside this file includes, but is not limited to:
a. ""vendors by bureau"" tab
b. ""FPDS filtered for DOC"" tab
i. Column AP
ii. Column CH - ""master_piid""
iii. Column CN - ""naics_code""
iv. Column CO - ""naics_description""
v. Column CS - ""piid"" - this is a code that often times aligns with the ""Award ID"" that allows you to research more details about the product/services provided
vi. Column DD - ""product_or_service_description""
c. ""vendors with most bureaus"" tab
d. any other data within the files or via external website(s)

1. Manipulation check: Should we use Chi-square before pairwise comparisons, or is binary logistic regression sufficient?

Only Apply If You Are the Best at What You Do.

We are looking for an elite land valuation specialist to take full ownership of our comping process. If you are someone who moves fast, thinks critically, and delivers precise, data-driven property valuations, this is your opportunity to join a high-performance real estate team.

This is not a beginner role.
This is not a task-based VA job.
This is an opportunity to be a key decision-maker in a fast-scaling land investment firm where your research directly impacts multi-million-dollar acquisitions.

If you’re looking for just another remote job, this isn’t it.
If you’re an absolute pro at land comping and want a role that rewards speed, accuracy, and ownership—keep reading.

Who We Are & Why This Role Matters

Higher Ground Land Company is not your average real estate business. We specialize in buying and selling vacant land across the U.S. Our acquisitions team moves at an elite speed, executing high-value deals every week.

Your role?
To be the foundation of our buying process.

Without precise comps, we don’t make offers.
Without smart valuations, we don’t close deals.
Without you, we can’t scale.

This is a high-stakes role for someone who thrives under pressure and takes complete ownership of their work.

What Winning Looks Like in This Role

You master the art of land comping using Redfin, Zillow, Land.com, MLS, county GIS maps, and other data tools to determine exact property values—no guessing.
You deliver fast, accurate comps based on sold and active listings—helping us make high-confidence investment decisions.
You analyze every detail that affects land value—road access, flood zones, wetlands, topography, existing structures, and market trends.
You complete 10-15 property comps per day with precision, allowing our acquisitions team to move at full speed.
You present your findings clearly in Google Sheets, making complex data easy to digest.
You own your role. This isn’t about checking off tasks—it’s about driving real business results.

Who You Are

You have direct experience comping land. House comping experience is not enough—you have worked in another land investment business and know how to evaluate vacant land.
You operate at an elite level. You can work fast and accurately under pressure—because you know every comp is a high-stakes decision.
You have a relentless attention to detail. You don’t just “pull data”—you analyze, verify, and refine comps to ensure accuracy.

Data Modeling & Analysis: Using techniques such as regression, classification, or clustering to build models that can predict outcomes or classify data. The goal is to create actionable insights that guide decision-making.

• Analytical mindset, capable of turning raw data into actionable insights.
• Excellent communication and interpersonal skills in English.
• Preferred
• Salesforce Advanced Administrator certification or additional Salesforce certs.
