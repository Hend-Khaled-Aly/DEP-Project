Flask App Checklist for High Scalability (1000+ Users Concurrently)
1. Code Structure & Maintainability
(Flask is more lightweight than Django, so we need to structure it well to avoid a messy monolith.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask Blueprints for modularity (e.g., users/, billing/, credits/, api/).
‚úîÔ∏è Separate files for routes, models, authentication, and utilities (Flask doesn‚Äôt enforce structure like Django).
‚úîÔ∏è Follow Flask best practices: Use application factory pattern to allow flexible configurations.
‚úîÔ∏è Avoid monolithic code by keeping reusable functions in utils/ and moving business logic outside routes.
‚úîÔ∏è Decouple services where possible (e.g., separate worker processes for background tasks).
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents spaghetti code that slows down scaling efforts.
Ensures new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.

2. Database Optimization (PostgreSQL)
(Using SQLAlchemy ORM instead of Django‚Äôs ORM.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use SQLAlchemy ORM (or Flask-SQLAlchemy) for database interaction.
‚úîÔ∏è Manually create indexes (Index('index_name', Model.field)) since Flask doesn‚Äôt auto-index like Django.
‚úîÔ∏è Use SQLAlchemy connection pooling (pool_pre_ping=True, pool_size=20, max_overflow=0).
‚úîÔ∏è Implement Redis/Memcached caching (e.g., Flask-Caching).
‚úîÔ∏è Prevent N+1 query problems by using joinedload() in SQLAlchemy.
‚úîÔ∏è Read Replicas: Set up read replicas to distribute database read requests.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Optimized queries allow faster responses under high load.
Connection pooling prevents too many open database connections.
Redis caching reduces database calls, improving response times.

3. Multi-User Support (1000+ Concurrent Users)
(Flask handles sessions differently than Django.)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask-Session to store session data in Redis instead of the database.
‚úîÔ∏è Generate unique session IDs and store them in Redis for fast lookups.
‚úîÔ∏è Use Celery + Redis for async tasks (e.g., processing outputs, deleting old data).
‚úîÔ∏è Paginate large dataset queries using Flask-SQLAlchemy‚Äôs pagination methods.
‚úîÔ∏è Rate limit requests per user/IP to prevent abuse and API overload.
‚úîÔ∏è Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple Flask instances behind a load balancer.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Redis prevents database session overload, making Flask faster under heavy load.
Load balancing distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers.
Rate limiting protects against DDoS attacks and server abuse.

4. AWS S3 Bucket (Input/Output Storage)
‚úîÔ∏è Store all user-generated content in S3 using boto3.
‚úîÔ∏è Use pre-signed URLs for secure file uploads/downloads.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement lifecycle policies for automatic old file deletion.
‚úîÔ∏è Restrict S3 permissions (ensure private access).
‚úîÔ∏è Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster file uploads/downloads globally.
‚úÖ How it helps:
No server storage needed, reducing system load.
Scalable storage solution that handles millions of files.
Faster access to files globally with S3 Transfer Acceleration.

5. Payments & Credit-Based System (Stripe)
‚úîÔ∏è Integrate Stripe API with Flask (stripe-python package).
‚úîÔ∏è Implement credit deduction logic only after successful processing.
‚úîÔ∏è Build a billing history table in PostgreSQL.
‚úîÔ∏è Admin panel for manual credit adjustments (use Flask-Admin or a custom dashboard).
‚úîÔ∏è Log failed payment attempts for debugging.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents fraudulent use of credits.
Ensures users get billed correctly even under high load.

6. Security & Protection
‚úîÔ∏è Enforce HTTPS and secure cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True).
‚úîÔ∏è Use Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement rate limiting using Flask-Limiter.
‚úîÔ∏è Enable CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.
‚úîÔ∏è Store API keys & secrets in .env files using python-dotenv.
‚úîÔ∏è Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) for extra protection against attacks.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Prevents API abuse with rate limits.
Protects against unauthorized access and session hijacking.

7. Deployment & Infrastructure (Auto-Scaling)
‚úîÔ∏è Use Gunicorn + Nginx for serving Flask in production.
‚úîÔ∏è Containerize with Docker (docker-compose.yml for easy deployment).
‚úîÔ∏è Enable auto-scaling with AWS ECS/Kubernetes/DigitalOcean Apps.
‚úîÔ∏è Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly.
‚úîÔ∏è Use health checks to detect and restart failing instances.
‚úÖ How it helps:
More instances launch automatically when traffic increases.
Load balancing ensures no single server gets overwhelmed.

8. Logging, Monitoring & Error Tracking
‚úîÔ∏è Use Sentry or Rollbar for real-time error tracking.
‚úîÔ∏è Implement logging for failed payments & user actions.
‚úîÔ∏è Monitor app performance using Prometheus + Grafana.
‚úîÔ∏è Set up alerts for high database usage or downtime.
‚úîÔ∏è Log Celery task failures for debugging async jobs.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Detects issues before they cause downtime.
Tracks high-usage areas to optimize performance.

9. Scheduled Cleanup Script (S3)
‚úîÔ∏è Use a cron job or Celery Beat to delete old files daily.
‚úîÔ∏è Store logs of deleted files for debugging.
‚úîÔ∏è Delete inactive user-generated files to save storage costs.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Reduces unnecessary storage costs.
Keeps the system optimized.

10. Documentation & ReadMe
‚úîÔ∏è Write a README explaining setup & usage.
‚úîÔ∏è Generate API documentation using Flask-Swagger/OpenAPI.
‚úîÔ∏è Add code comments for complex logic.
‚úîÔ∏è Create Postman collections for API testing.
‚úÖ How it helps:
Onboards new developers quickly.

I have built on Nextjs a platform for actuaries (a niche domain in insurance) and insurance companies,  where actuaries can find missions and insurance companies can find actuaries.
I am now in the phase of implementing the payment process.
Although I already thought about some features like
- the actuary has a interface where he can enter his number of days worked.
- the actuary cannot change his worked day passed a certain time.
- the employer can see how many days the freelancer worked
- the employer can pay the actuary at a fixed frequency, either 2 or 4 weeks (agreed by both the actuary and the employer)
- the employer must send to us some part of the money beforehand. Our platform will act as an escrow payment. This is to ensure trust and reliability to our freelancers. But also for employers who don't pay directly the freelancer even before the mission.
- actuary and employer can dispute and claim refunds

I would like this feature to be built by someone who already implemented this kind of timesheet + payment process as I might have forgotten important things (security issues, features to ensure a smooth ux, etc.)

The Situation:

I‚Äôm using FlutterFlow to connect my app with an API (using API Flow). The setup is mostly done‚ÄîI‚Äôve connected the API, and it seems to be communicating fine. But here‚Äôs the issue:

The Problem:

While the API call is successfully triggered, the data isn‚Äôt showing up on the UI as expected. ü§î
I‚Äôve confirmed the API connection and set up the data flow, but FlutterFlow‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt seem to fetch or display the data correctly.

What I‚Äôve Tried:
1. Checked API connection settings: API key and URL seem fine.
2. Used dynamic data sources in FlutterFlow to bind API data to the UI.

What‚Äôs Next:

I‚Äôm thinking of bringing in a FlutterFlow expert to help me with:
1. Fixing the data-binding issue between the API response and the UI.
2. Ensuring the API call is properly mapped to the fields that need to display the data.
3. Debugging any potential CORS or data handling problems that might be causing the issue.

This dashboard would be giving real time trade performance information for every strategy, and there would be a ranking leaderboard for the most profitable strategies the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Besides the main dashboard itself, each strategy would need to be able to be clicked on to view more detailed strategy performance of each strategy. A user would then have the option to copy that strategy and automate it in a simple copy bot format.

Key requirements:

- We do not know how to integrate the backtest and live forward test performance metrics from TradingView, whether that be through API, webhooks, or web scraping - but we would want a developer that could figure that out.
- The user interface should provide a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics. A ranking leaderboard of the most profitable strategies for different time periods (7 days, 30 days, 90 days)
- Experience with TradingView and its API, Web Scraping, Webhooks.
- Proven track record in developing trading bots.
- Familiarity with the mentioned trading platforms.
- Strong programming skills, preferably in Python or JavaScript.
- Proficiency in web development with experience in creating interactive dashboards.
- A strong understanding of data visualization techniques.
- Prior experience working with TradingView or similar trading platforms is required.


PHASE 1 WOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

- Strategy Performance Dashboard with Ranking Leaderboard of Strategies based on net profit % during certain time periods.
- Detailed Performance Page for each individual strategy from the dashboard.
- Admin Panel to add/edit/or remove TradingView strategies.
- Admin Panel to add/edit/ or remove users to use the dashboard platform.
- User Favorites page where users can view the strategies they have favorited from the dashboard. (only if we don't do phase 2)

TradingView Integrations
‚Ä¢ Connect to TradingView backtesting data through API, webhooks, web scraping or however possible. (for live data, strategy tracking) Would need the developer to find the best solution for this.

PHASE 2 WOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

Incorporating a Trading Bot (Copy Bot) into the strategy performance tracking dashboard.
Users would be able to select a strategy to automate and copy the signals from.
Would want the following exchanges broker included - Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, Robinhood, Tradovate, Tradestation, MetaTrader, Interactive Brokers.

- Creating the bot dashboard (simple, easy to use system for users)
- Connecting Exchanges/Brokers panel.
- Trade History panel
- User Live Trade Portfolio panel.

We were considering doing phase 1 first and then phase 2, but depending on cost and timeline of the project, we may decide to go ahead and do both 1 and 2 now.

I‚Äôm facing an issue with Flask session persistence after the OAuth login flow with Google. When the user logs in and is redirected back to my site, a new session is created, causing the app to lose stored credentials.

Issue Details:
- The Flask app is storing Google OAuth credentials in the session (session[""google_credentials""]).
- After the OAuth login redirect (/google/callback), the session is lost and a new session file is created in the flask_session folder.
- Debugging confirms:
   - Cookies are enabled and being set in the browser.
   - Session data exists before redirect but disappears after.
session.keys() only shows [""_permanent""] after the redirect.
- I have tried setting:
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = ""None""
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   - SESSION_TYPE = ""filesystem""
- Issue persists despite these fixes.

Project Details:
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Auth Flow: Google OAuth 2.0
- Session Management: Flask-Session (filesystem-based)
- Hosting: Local development for now (planning for deployment)

Deliverables:
- Diagnose and fix the session persistence issue.
- Ensure session[""google_credentials""] is retained after the redirect.
- Provide a clear explanation of the fix so I can implement it in the future.
- Verify Google Calendar API authentication works properly.

We‚Äôre looking for an experienced web developer to help with a major update to our custom-coded web app. This project involves three key objectives:

1. Web App Migration & CMS Integration
- We need to separate the web app portion from the marketing pages (home page, blog, etc.) while keeping everything on the same domain.
- The web app is currently hosted on the root domain, and we need a solution that allows us to integrate a CMS (like WordPress, Webflow, or another recommended option) for managing marketing content without breaking existing user-generated links.
- URL structure and redirects must be carefully planned to maintain functionality and SEO integrity.

2. Audio Player Engine Optimization
- Our web app includes a custom audio player, but it needs performance improvements to ensure smoother playback and better responsiveness.
- Optimization should address any lag, buffering, or playback inconsistencies across devices and browsers.

3. Enhanced Player Customization Options
We want to introduce additional customization features for the audio player, including (but not limited to):
- Custom branding options (fonts and layout adjustments)

Ideal Candidate
- Strong experience in custom web development, including frontend and backend work.
- Expertise in web app migrations and domain management without breaking existing user-generated URLs.
- Proficiency in React, Ruby on Rails, and AWS (please specify your experience).
- Experience with audio streaming optimization is a big plus.
- Knowledge of CMS integration (WordPress, Webflow, or similar) and how to manage content separately from a web app.
- Strong communication skills and the ability to provide clear recommendations for implementation.

Next Steps

If you‚Äôre interested, please send:
- A brief overview of your experience related to the points above.
- Examples of past work, especially involving web app migrations or audio player development.
- Your proposed approach for handling the migration without disrupting existing links.

We are looking for an experienced developer to build a document scanning and editing feature within our SaaS-based fleet management platform. This feature will enable fleet managers to upload, scan, and edit work orders, invoices, and maintenance records with high accuracy and efficiency. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface where users can click on the document to highlight corresponding fields in the form, and vice versa (similar to Nanonets).
The front-end should align with the UX/UI standards of modern SaaS applications, ensuring a seamless, structured workflow for processing scanned work orders. The system should handle large document sets efficiently, validate extracted data, and provide a guided review process for error correction.

https://app.nanonets.com/ is a great example app that does this well. Here is a video showing it:
https://www.loom.com/share/f5aa28ec26e54da49e9ea191f4b1b904

Technical Scope
Document Upload & Processing
File Upload UI:
Drag-and-drop and direct file selection.
Show a real-time progress bar during upload.
Validate file formats and display a preview before submission.
OCR & Data Extraction:
Extract key fields from work orders, invoices, and maintenance logs (e.g., date, vendor, part details, labor costs, total amounts).
Implement error handling and detailed feedback for missing or incorrectly parsed fields.

Interactive Editing & Validation
Two-way document interaction:
Clicking a field in the document highlights the corresponding field in the form, and vice versa.
Allow inline editing of all extracted values.
Editable fields include cost, quantity, unit price, markup, and descriptions.
Bounding Box Coordination:
Each extracted field is visually outlined in the document with a bounding box.
When a user selects a field in the form, the corresponding bounding box in the document is highlighted for better visibility.
Users can drag and resize bounding boxes to correct OCR misalignment if needed.
Implement real-time field linking where adjustments in the bounding box automatically update the extracted value in the form.
Ensure bounding boxes adapt dynamically for multi-page documents and various font styles.
Guided Validation & Review:
Introduce a step-by-step verification process with collapsible sections for labor, parts, and total costs.
Users must check off each section before submitting.
Error-checking bubbles should provide inline hints for verification.
Zoom & Navigation Improvements:
A hand tool should allow smooth movement inside the zoomed document (instead of using scroll bars).
Ensure smooth scrolling behavior where the left panel (document preview) remains fixed, while the right panel (form) scrolls independently.

Expected Deliverables
‚úÖ Fully functional document scanning & editing tool integrated into the fleet management platform.
‚úÖ User-friendly UI/UX for uploading, validating, and editing scanned work orders.
‚úÖ Real-time interactive editing between scanned documents and form fields.
‚úÖ Optimized OCR pipeline that minimizes scan time while maintaining accuracy.
‚úÖ Guided walkthrough validation process with collapsible sections and inline hints.



Skills Required
üü¢ Frontend: React.js, Ant Design (preferred), modern UI frameworks.
üü¢ Backend: Node.js, Python (for OCR/AI processing), SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
üü¢ File Processing: PDF/image parsing, error handling, validation

Automate import processes for vendor-provided part lists (CSV, Excel, or API feeds).

4. Website Synchronization

Build an API that allows the website to pull live data from the cloud database or SaaS solution.

Ensure website updates include part availability, descriptions, and compatibility information in real-time.

Optimize performance for fast queries and reliable uptime. Eventually we would like to move into ecommerce platform such as Suite commerce or Big Commerce.

5. Error Handling & Reporting

Implement automated checks for duplicate records, missing part descriptions, and pricing mismatches.

Develop an admin dashboard for our team members to review and correct flagged errors before syncing data.

Ideal Candidate Skills & Experience

Our ideal candidate is someone who truly understands ElizaOS and can deliver high-quality, reliable work.

After a previous experience where a self-proclaimed expert ended in a dispute after just eight hours, we need someone who can demonstrate proven expertise and strong accountability!

Project Overview
Our current setup includes a basic running agent built from a character file. Your primary responsibility will be to extend this agent with a new ElizaOS plugin. This plugin should:

1) Database Integration & Learning:
Read messages from our database, learn from them, and evolve the agent over time. The agent must be capable of understanding conversation topics and tracking who has discussed what.

2) Website Content Embedding:
Seamlessly integrate and continuously update content from our markdown-based Docusaurus website. The plugin should fetch the latest updates (potentially reading from a few directories down in the Docusaurus folder) to ensure the agent always reflects current information.

While these features exist within ElizaOS, we only need your expertise to connect them effectively and to propose additional improvements that enhance overall functionality.

### **Freelancer Needed: Website Performance Optimization (WordPress + Divi + Hostinger + Cloudflare)**  

We are looking for an experienced web developer to optimize our WordPress website built with **Divi** and hosted on **Hostinger**. We use **Cloudflare CDN** (which has been purged) and the **LiteSpeed Cache plugin**, but we need to fix **the root cause** of our **page and image loading issues**, not just rely on caching plugins.  

#### **Project Overview**  
Our website has **page speed issues** affecting user experience and SEO. Our **Pingdom, GTmetrix, and PageSpeed Insights** reports highlight issues related to **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, which we need to fix.  

**Key Metrics (PageSpeed Insights on Mobile, Slow 4G, Moto G Power Emulation):**

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 5.2s  
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** 120ms  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.509  
- **Speed Index:** 4.0s  

### **What Needs to Be Fixed?**  
We need a developer who can **directly optimize our site** by working on:  

#### **1. Image Optimization (Prevent LCP & CLS Issues)**  
- Ensure **all images have explicit width and height attributes** to prevent layout shifts.  
- Fix **""media element lacking an explicit size""** errors.  
- Implement **lazy loading properly** while maintaining image dimensions.  
- Use **CSS object-fit: cover/contain** to prevent distortion.  

#### **2. Reduce Unused JavaScript & CSS**  
- Identify and remove **unused JavaScript (potential savings: 146 KB)**.  
- Reduce **unused CSS (potential savings: 18 KB)**.  
- Avoid **serving legacy JavaScript** to modern browsers (9 KB savings).  
- Optimize **JavaScript execution and defer unnecessary scripts** to improve FCP/LCP.  

#### **3. Improve Render & Loading Performance**  
- **Fix CLS issues** related to shifting elements, including **Divi modules, carousel images, and navigation elements**.  
- **Minimize HTTP requests** and optimize the **critical rendering path**.  
- Address **long main-thread tasks** and **avoid chaining critical requests**.  
- Serve **static assets with an efficient cache policy** (29 resources identified).  
- **Enable Gzip compression** (F23) to reduce response times by 70%.  

#### **4. Fix Layout & UI Issues**  
- Improve **accessibility** by fixing **contrast issues, navigation order, and viewport settings**.  
- Ensure **consistent heading structure** (h1, h2, h3 should not skip levels).  
- Fix **buttons and text contrast issues** for better readability.  

### **Requirements**  
‚úÖ Strong expertise in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
‚úÖ Experience with **WordPress, Divi, and Hostinger**  
‚úÖ Familiarity with **Cloudflare, CDN optimization, and LiteSpeed Cache**  
‚úÖ Ability to **debug layout shifts and fix core web vitals issues without relying on plugins**  
‚úÖ Strong understanding of **PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, GTmetrix, and Pingdom**  

**Bonus Skills:**  
‚ûï Experience with **WebP images, modern script deployment, and reducing third-party script dependencies**  
‚ûï Familiarity with **Chrome DevTools for code coverage analysis**  

### **How to Apply**  
Please send us:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ A brief overview of your experience with **WordPress performance optimization**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Examples of similar **speed optimization projects** you've completed.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Your estimated **timeline and pricing**.  

We want **real fixes** to the core issues, not just another plugin solution.

I now want to add a feature that ingests a long video (assume 1 hour) and identifies the viral %10% best clips and cuts them into short vids for Tiktok, Reels, YT Shorts, etc.

Therefore, the logic must be SMART enough to figure out which parts of the long video are worth cutting.

** IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE, THEN YOU ARE THE PERSON I WANT TO WORK WITH. **

We obviously use:
- NodeJS / Next JS
- FFmpeg
- Remotion
- OpenAI or other AI LLM to do the identification and cutting.

REQUIREMENTS:
----
1) DELIVERABLE - You present me with working flow. You get paid and a great review.

2) SOLUTION & COST PER VIDEO PROCESSED (cost per video rendering) - the solution must be cheap to create a video -- obviously if it costs $5 to cut a single video, it's NOT marketable. I'm looking for a solution that can get such videos renderered in cents.

3) SMART SELECTION OF CLIPS & CUTTING - the clips chosen by the AI must make sense and be the best clips of the video. Obviously. we can't be perfect all the time but you shouldn't have basic issues like cutting off the voice mid-sentence, choosing completely irrelevant clips, etc.

4) TECH STACK - Must use our tech stack as this feature will be bolted on to an existing app that is built on NodeJS (back-end), NextJS (frontend), MongoDB (database), and Redis for caching. We already use FFmpeg which you will need.

5) TIMELINE - Want this done within 2 weeks or less.

6) COMMENTED CODE - well structured, clean, commented code so that my dev can easily bolt it on to my app.

CallIQ is a SaaS tool that connects to Gong, Jiminny, or Fathom via API and allows users to query their sales calls using AI (OpenAI GPT-4). We are looking for a Bubble.io expert to build an MVP.

Project Requirements

MVP Features:

Allow users to input their API key and fetch sales call transcripts.

Enable AI-powered queries (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat are my top objections?‚Äù).

Create a clean, simple dashboard (Bubble.io preferred).

We aim to launch quickly, validate demand, and expand features later.

Project Details

1. Overview

CallIQ is a low-code SaaS MVP that connects conversation intelligence platforms (Gong, Jiminny, Fathom) and extracts actionable sales insights from calls using AI.

The MVP should be built using Bubble.io (preferred) or Webflow + Make/Zapier if needed.

Show a call transcript preview (first 500 characters).

Handle API errors (e.g., invalid key, no data returned).

AI Query Interface (OpenAI GPT-4):

Users enter natural language queries (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat objections were mentioned?‚Äù).

Call GPT-4 API to analyze call transcripts and return AI-generated insights.

Display text-based insights (bullet points, summaries).

Keep response times fast (~5 seconds per query).

Simple Dashboard (List of Calls + Insights Output):

Display recent calls fetched via API.

Users can click a call to view its transcript and run AI-powered analysis.

Provide simple text-based output (no complex charts for now).

No Calls Found: Display a friendly message.

Failed AI Query: Retry option and error logging.

Minimal, Clean UI (User-Friendly):

Simple, modern Bubble.io layout (clean and easy to navigate).

Current setup: We have a WordPress website with booking functionality built using Guesty's Open API. The code is currently located in the WordPress theme editor.

Existing features: The site displays a search box, listings, and booking options.

Problem: We've realized that we need to add filters to our listings and change from a base price to a calendar-based pricing system. Unfortunately, the Open API isn't ideal for these requirements.

1. User Registration and Profiles
Sign Up / Log In: Standard email/password or social logins.
Profile Settings: Basic information, notification preferences, and language settings.

2. Flashcard Creation & Management

Organized Sets: Users can group flashcards into themed sets or subjects (like Quizlet).
Search & Filter: By title, subject, difficulty, or date created.
Share Options (optional, if time permits): Let users share sets with friends or make them public.

4. Study & Quiz Features
Flip-Based Study: Show front side first, then reveal the answer on the back (like traditional flashcards).
Difficulty/Confidence Rating: After viewing an answer, user labels how easy or hard it was. This data can feed a spaced repetition algorithm so that harder cards appear more frequently.
Progress Tracking: Display how many cards are left, correct/incorrect counts, or a progress bar.
Multiple Question Types (optional): If possible, beyond just ‚Äúflip cards,‚Äù we might introduce multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

5. AI/Spaced Repetition Integration
Adaptive Scheduling: Cards rated ‚Äúhard‚Äù appear more often than easier ones (similar to Anki).

It will provide tools for uploading cruise sheets (forestry measurement data), calculating various timber volume metrics (calculations provided), and visualizing forest composition with basic graphs.

-Core Capabilities-

Property and Stand Management

Create and manage multiple forest properties
Organize forests into logical ""stands"" (management units)
Track data by geographic region to apply appropriate regional conversion factors
Delete properties and stands when no longer needed


Data Import and Processing

Upload Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) timber cruise sheets
Process raw data into standardized metrics
Store data in a structured database for analysis


Volume Calculations

Calculate key forestry metrics from basal area measurements:

Basal area per acre (ft¬≤)
Stems per acre
Cords per acre
Cubic feet per acre
Tons per acre
MBF (thousand board feet) per acre




Region-Specific Calculations

Apply different conversion factors (provided) for various US regions:

Northeast
Southeast
Midwest
West
Pacific Northwest


Account for regional differences in tree growth patterns and measurement standards


Species-Specific Factors

Apply species-specific modifiers (provided) to account for differences in:

Wood density
Tree form
Growth patterns

Support for numerous tree species including:

Softwoods (Red Spruce, White Pine, Balsam Fir, etc.)
Hardwoods (Oak, Maple, Birch, etc.)


Visualization Tools

Generate charts and graphs including:

Species composition pie charts
Volume distribution bar charts


Display summary statistics in tabular format
Compare data across stands and properties


Data Export

Export data to PDF for reports and documentation
Print capability as a fallback for PDF generation


User Access Control

User-specific data management (each user can only see their own properties)


Administration Features

Shortcode integration ([forest_inventory]) for embedding the tool on any page


Technical Implementation
The plugin follows WordPress plugin architecture best practices:

Separate admin and public-facing components
Database tables for properties, stands, and inventory data
AJAX-based data processing for a responsive user experience
Integration with Chart.js for data visualization
Dependency management for required libraries (PhpSpreadsheet for Excel processing)
Internationalization support

Data Processing Methodology
The plugin employs a sophisticated two-factor approach to calculate timber volumes:

Regional base factors specific to different parts of the country
Species-specific modifiers that account for differences in wood properties

This approach provides more accurate volume estimates than a one-size-fits-all calculation method and allows for professional-grade timber inventory management directly within WordPress.
User Interface
The interface is divided into four main tabs:

Properties - View and manage existing properties and stands
Create Property - Add new forest properties to the system
Add Stand - Upload cruise data for a specific stand within a property

Project Overview:

I‚Äôve built an app that enables quick, on-the-fly proposal creation during sales calls. These proposals can be updated post-call, shared via live links, and compared side-by-side. However, I need help solving a few major challenges:

Key Challenges to Solve:
1. Optimize Shared Results Load Time
‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúShared Results‚Äù page, which displays past proposals, takes too long to load (sometimes over 1.5 minutes).
‚Ä¢ It includes details such as proposal creator, assignee, attendees, creation date, status (draft/published), and actions (edit, delete, copy, view).
‚Ä¢ I need improvements in query efficiency and performance to make this load faster.
2. Fix OpenAI Integration for Proposal Summaries
‚Ä¢ The proposal editor includes a ‚ÄúGenerate Summary‚Äù feature that should extract key details from a transcript via OpenAI.
‚Ä¢ The summary sections include:
‚Ä¢ Introduction
‚Ä¢ Solution Overview
‚Ä¢ Current Situation
‚Ä¢ Future Goals
‚Ä¢ Challenges
‚Ä¢ Currently, generating summaries fails with the error: ‚ÄúAnalysis error. Failed to send a request to the edge function.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ I need help diagnosing whether this is an issue with my Supabase edge function or the OpenAI API request.
3. Potential Expansion: AI Demo System
‚Ä¢ I have a table containing URLs for live AI demos that simulate real-world AI chat experiences.
‚Ä¢ I want to create a searchable demo experience where users can select an industry and test AI interactions relevant to their needs.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm unsure whether this should be a separate project or an extension of my current system. I‚Äôd love input on the best approach.

Ideal Skills & Experience:
‚Ä¢ Supabase: Experience optimizing queries and edge functions.
‚Ä¢ OpenAI API: Familiarity with integrating AI-driven text generation.
‚Ä¢ Full-Stack Development: Strong background in backend optimization and UI performance.
‚Ä¢ Database Performance Optimization: Ability to debug slow-loading pages and speed up data retrieval.
‚Ä¢ Mentorship & Collaboration: Willingness to walk me through the process, answer questions, and explain decisions.
‚Ä¢ Experience with AI Demos (Optional): If you have experience building interactive AI showcases, that‚Äôs a bonus.

Next Steps:

If this sounds like a project you can help with, please include:
‚Ä¢ A brief explanation of how you would approach fixing the slow-loading shared results page.

We need to make an easy client portal based on an excel sheet, in that client portal they can onboard and need to accept changes.

Project Title:
Build a Customer-Facing Portal in Softr for Airbnb Optimization Agency

Project Overview:
We run an agency that optimizes listings. We need a customer-facing portal built in Softr, integrated with our Google Sheet (link to sheet).

This portal should allow our clients to:

Approve the first optimization before it goes live.
View a graph displaying the number of optimizations done over time.
Attach feedback to a listing (feedback should be stored in a new row in the Google Sheet).
Onboard new listings through a form submission.
Key Features & Requirements:
1. Authentication & Client Access
Clients should log in using email authentication.
Each client should only see their own listings (filtered by email).
2. Approval System for First Optimization
If a listing has not been optimized before, the client should see a ""Pending Approval"" status.
The client clicks ""Approve"", and the status updates in the Google Sheet.
3. Graph of Optimizations Done
A chart should visualize the number of optimizations done per client over time.
This data should be pulled dynamically from the Google Sheet.
4. Client Feedback Submission
Clients should be able to leave feedback for each listing.
Feedback should be saved as a new row in the Google Sheet.
5. Client Onboarding for New Listings
Clients should have a ""Add New Listing"" form.
Submitted listings should be added as a new row in the Google Sheet.
Tech Stack & Integration:
Softr for the frontend customer portal.
Google Sheets as the backend database.
Zapier/Make (optional) for automating updates.
Ideal Candidate:
